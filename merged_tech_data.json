    "text_ref": "1. Get a wireless router. Most ISPs will supply you with both a Wi-Fi router and modem, or a Wi-Fi router/modem combo. If your ISP only provides a modem, or you don't want to rent a Wi-Fi router from them, you can buy your own. Various factors will determine which router is best for you, including speed, bandwidth capabilities, and Wi-Fi coverage/distance. Speed These days, all wireless routers (even the budget models) are pretty fast. If you need ultra-fast Wi-Fi speeds—perhaps multiple devices will be streaming movies in 4k or 8k, gaming, or sharing large amounts of data at the same time—opt for a router with Wi-Fi 7 technology . If you're on a budget and want blazingly fast but don't need extreme , opt for a Wi-Fi 6 router . Distance If you have a very large home, consider a mesh router system instead of a standalone Wi-Fi router. Mesh Wi-Fi systems consist of a router with a series of nodes to expand the coverage in all areas of your home. 2.4GHz or 5Ghz 2.4 GHz covers a wider distance, is supported by more devices, and is good at penetrating walls and large furniture. However, it's more prone to interference because more devices (including cordless phones) use this frequency. 5 GHz is faster and less prone to interference, but it does have a smaller coverage area and cannot penetrate solid objects as well as 2.4GHz. Security The highest level of security is WPA3, but some devices (including Nintendo Switch) don't support it. Choose a router that has a WPA2/WPA3 Transitional mode, which allows newer devices to use WPA3 and older devices to use WPA2. 2. Connect the modem to the appropriate port on your wall. If you have a separate modem, connect it to the DSL, cable, or fiber port on your wall using the cable provided to you by your ISP, and turn the unit on. If the modem and router are one unit, connect that to the wall port, and turn the unit on. 3. Connect the router to your modem and turn it on. If the router is separate from the modem, you'll need to connect it to the modem using an ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into the port on the back of the router labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet or similar, and the other end into the modem's LAN port. 4. Place your router. For the best possible signal , position the wireless router in a central location, away from walls and metal objects, and not on the floor. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Any obstacles will degrade the signal. Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router. 5. Connect your computer or phone to the router. Some routers have a mobile app you can install that makes Wi-Fi setup a breeze—check your router's documentation to see if you can download an app and use it to set up your router. If not, you'll need to connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable to set up your wireless network. 6. Log in to the router's admin page. If you connected your computer via ethernet, you'll need to open the router's configuration page and sign in with the admin password. Open a web browser and enter the router's web address. According to Showers, the IP address is typically https://192.168.1.1, https://192.168.0.1, or https://10.0.0.1, but can vary based on the router model. [4] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address. The router will ask you for a login name and password, or sometimes just a password. The password you'll need to use is in your router's documentation or sometimes printed on a sticker on the back of the router. If you bought a used router, you can find the default admin password for most routers at https://portforward.com/router-password . 7. Enter your internet connection information. In most cases, your router should obtain this information automatically from your modem. If it doesn't, you may need to enter some information about your internet connection—often a username and password and DNS server addresses. If you're not sure what to enter, contact your ISP. 8. Set up your Wi-Fi access point. Locate the Wireless or Wi-Fi section of your router's configuration page. You can enable Wi-Fi, change the network name, and set the security level here. The \"SSID\" field is where you'll enter a name for your Wi-Fi router. This is the name people will see when they want to connect to the internet. If you live in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it. Make sure to set the security/encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. This will most likely be WPA3 (best) or WPA2 (less good, but more compatible with older devices). Create a password for your Wi-Fi network. While this is not required, Showers recommends it. \"Creating a strong password, combining letters, numbers, and special characters is important to enhance security,\" he says. [5] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview 9. Apply your settings. Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment (or reboot), and your new settings will take effect. 10. Connect your devices to Wi-Fi. Once the router is online, you can connect your Wi-Fi capable devices so they can access the internet. Android Swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon to open your Wi-Fi settings. Slide the \"Wi-Fi\" switch to \"ON\" (or tap the option to Use Wi-Fi ). Select your Wi-Fi network name. iPhone or iPad Open Settings . Tap Wi-Fi . Tap the switch ON . Select your Wi-Fi network's name. Windows 10/11 Click the network icon in the taskbar, which usually looks like a Wi-Fi fan or similar to the bars you normally see at the top of your cell phone. It may be a globe if you're not currently connected. Click your Wi-Fi network's name. Click Connect . Mac Click the Wi-Fi icon (the fan) in the menu bar. Select your Wi-Fi network. 11. Enter the password. Type the password you created when configuring your Wi-Fi router, and click Connect or similar. Once the password is accepted, your device will be connected to the Wi-Fi access point. 12. Test your internet connection. Once you are connected to the network, wait a moment for your IP address to be assigned. Open a web browser and try to connect to a website you don't normally visit to ensure you aren't loading the website from memory.",

Be sure to close any windows you don't want open. [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source This method will quickly capture everything on your screen and save the image to your PC. Once you've saved the screenshot, you can edit it or share it with anyone. 2. Find the ⎙ Print Screen key on your keyboard. The Print Screen key is often found on the upper-right side of the keyboard, not counting the numeric keypad. [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source The Print Screen key will usually be abbreviated to \"PrtSc\" or something similar. If your keyboard doesn't have a Print Screen key, use the Snipping Tool on Windows 10 or Windows 11 . [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source You can also use the On-Screen Keyboard and locate the PrtScn button beneath the Insert button. 3. Take your screenshot. You have two options for capturing your entire screen: Instantly save the screenshot as an image: Press the Windows key and the PrtSc keys at the same time. This saves your screenshot as a PNG file to the Screenshots folder in your Pictures folder. On most keyboards, the Windows key is located in the bottom left corner on the same row as the spacebar. Upon pressing this key combination, the screen may dim briefly to indicate that the screenshot was captured. Copy the screenshot so you can paste it: Press the Print Screen key alone to copy the screen to your PC's clipboard. You can then paste the copied screenshot into a document, email message, or social media post by right-clicking the desired location and selecting Paste . With some Windows laptops or keyboards, you will need to hold down the Fn key as you press the Print Screen key. 4. Find the screenshot. If you used Windows key + Print Screen to capture the screenshot, follow these steps to find the file : Open File Explorer by pressing Windows key + E on your keyboard. If you see a folder called Pictures in the left panel, click it. If not, click This PC , and then double-click the Pictures folder. Double-click the Screenshots folder. Each screenshot you take is labeled \"Screenshot (number).\" Depending on the version of Windows you're using, the file name will either end with a number that corresponds with the number of screenshots you've taken, or the date and time at which you captured the screenshot. If you can't find your screenshot, try using the Snipping Tool instead. See Snipping Tool (Windows 11) or Snipping Tool (Windows 10 and earlier) .",

Here's a visual guide on how to take a screenshot on Windows, followed by the text steps.\n\nThere are several ways to take screenshots on Windows, but here are two common and easy methods:\n\n**Method 1: Using the Print Screen Key (PrtSc)**\n\n1.  **Capture the entire screen:** Press the `PrtSc` key (sometimes labeled `Print Screen` or `PrtScn`) on your keyboard. This copies the entire screen to your clipboard.\n    2.  **Capture an active window:** Press `Alt + PrtSc`. This copies only the currently active window to your clipboard.\n    3.  **Paste the screenshot:** Open an image editor (like Paint, Photoshop, or even Microsoft Word) and press `Ctrl + V` to paste the screenshot. You can then save it as an image file.\n    **Method 2: Using the Snipping Tool (Windows 10 & 11)**\n\nThe Snipping Tool offers more flexibility in capturing specific parts of your screen.\n\n1.  **Open the Snipping Tool:**\n    *   **Windows 10:** Type \"Snipping Tool\" in the Windows search bar and select it.\n    *   **Windows 11:** Type \"Snipping Tool\" in the Windows search bar and select it, or use the shortcut `Windows key + Shift + S`.\n\n2.  **Select a snip mode:**\n    *   **Rectangular Snip:** Drag the cursor to form a rectangle around the area you want to capture.\n    *   **Free-form Snip:** Draw any shape around the area you want to capture.\n    *   **Window Snip:** Select a specific window you want to capture.\n    *   **Full-screen Snip:** Captures the entire screen.\n    3.  **Capture and edit:** Once you've made your selection, the screenshot will appear in the Snipping Tool window (or Snip & Sketch on Windows 11), where you can annotate, highlight, or crop it.\n    ",

Here's a visual guide and text steps to help you take a screenshot on Windows:\n\n### Visual Guide:\n\n1. **Method 1: Using the Print Screen (PrtScn) Key**\n   - Press the PrtScn key on your keyboard. This key is usually located above the number pad and is labeled as \"Print Screen\" or \"PrtScn\".\n   - The screenshot will be saved to your clipboard. You can then paste it into an image editing software or a document.\n\n2. **Method 2: Using the Snipping Tool**\n   - Open the Snipping Tool by searching for it in the Start menu or by pressing the Windows key + Shift + S.\n   - The Snipping Tool will open. You can choose to take a free-form snip, a rectangular snip, a window snip, or a full-screen snip.\n   - After taking the snip, you can save it to your computer.\n\n3. **Method 3: Using the Windows Key + Shift + S**\n   - Press the Windows key + Shift + S. This will open the Snipping Tool in a more compact form.\n   - You can choose to take a free-form snip, a rectangular snip, a window snip, or a full-screen snip.\n   - After taking the snip, you can save it to your computer.\n\n### Text Steps:\n\n#### Method 1: Using the Print Screen (PrtScn) Key\n1. Press the PrtScn key on your keyboard.\n2. The screenshot will be saved to your clipboard.\n3. Open an image editing software or a document.\n4. Press Ctrl + V to paste the screenshot.\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Snipping Tool\n1. Open the Snipping Tool by searching for it in the Start menu or by pressing the Windows key + Shift + S.\n2. Choose the type of snip you want to take (free-form, rectangular, window, or full-screen).\n3. Take the snip.\n4. Save the snip to your computer.\n\n#### Method 3: Using the Windows Key + Shift + S\n1. Press the Windows key + Shift + S.\n2. Choose the type of snip you want to take (free-form, rectangular, window, or full-screen).\n3. Take the snip.\n4. Save the snip to your computer.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- To save the screenshot to a specific location, you can specify a file name and location when saving the snip.\n- You can also use the Snipping Tool to annotate your screenshot before saving it.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily take a screenshot on your Windows computer.",

    "text_ref": "1. Connect the modem to the first router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the WAN port of a router to the WAN/Internet port of the high-speed modem. For the purpose of this wikiHow, we will refer to the router that’s connected to the modem as “Router 1.\" Some routers act as a high-speed modem and router. If this is the case for Router 1, simply connect it to the cable that carries your internet connection. The WAN port may be labeled “Internet.” 2. Connect Router 1 to a computer. Use an Ethernet cable to connect from one of Router 1’s LAN ports to a computer’s Ethernet port. You can also connect to the router wirelessly using the wi-fi name and passkey. 3. Turn on the modem and Router 1. Allow a few moments for them both to boot up. 4. Open a web browser. You’ll need a web browser to connect to the admin user interface of Router 1. 5. Enter Router 1's IP address in the address bar. Type the IP address for Router 1 into the address bar at the top of your web browser. This opens the router's admin login screen. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default IP address for Router 1. Here are some default IP addresses for common router brands: 2Wire: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.254, 10.0.0.138 Apple: 10.0.0.1 Belkin: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1 Dlink: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.101, 192.168.0.30, 192.168.0.50, 192.168.15.1, 192.168.254.254, 192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.10, 192.168.15.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1, 10.90.90.90, Netgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227 6. Log in using Router 1's admin username and password. This opens Router 1's admin user interface. Check the user's manual, or the manufacturer's website to find the default username and password for the Router 1. Most router's use \"admin\" as the username and password. You can also try \"Password\" or \"12345678\" as the password. For some router's, the username or password is left blank. If you’re using the right password but still can’t connect, check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn how to reset the router's to it's factory settings. 7. Enable DHCP on Router 1. This will allow Router 1 to assign all of the IP addresses in your network. You can usually find these settings under “Network settings,” or “LAN settings.” The admin user interface layout is different from one router make and model to another. In most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default. 8. Test your network and internet connection. [6] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Visit any website (like https://www.wikihow.com ) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1. 9. Disconnect Router 1 from the computer. Remove the Ethernet cable between Router 1 and the computer. Everything else can remain on and plugged in. 10. Plug the second router in and turn it on. Make sure you have a free electrical outlet and a computer near where you want the second router to be located. Plug it in and turn it on. For the purposes of this wikiHow, we will refer to the second router as \"Router 2\". 11. Connect a computer to the Router 2. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the LAN port on Router 2. Then connect to the Ethernet port on a computer. 12. Type Router 2's IP address in the address bar of a web browser. This opens the admin login screen for Router 2. With most router's, the IP address is 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1. 13. Log in using Router 2's username and password. Use the default username and password to log in to the admin user interface for Router 2, just as you did with Router 1. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default username and password. With most routers, \"admin\" is both the username and password. 14. Disable DHCP on Router 2. Since DHCP is enabled on Router 1, it should be disabled on Router 2 to prevent IP conflicts. Locate the DHCP settings in the admin user interface and switch the DHCP server to “Off.” 15. Assign a new IP address to Router 2. As of now, there’s a good possibility that Routers 1 and 2 have the same default IP address. To prevent IP conflicts, Router 2 needs to have a different IP address than Router 1. Find the area in the routers admin user interface called “LAN” or “Local Network.” There should be a box that contains the current IP address. Type a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new IP address on Router 2 must be on the same subnet as Router 1. This means the first three sets of numbers in the IP address should be the same as Router 1. Change the number after the third period in the IP address to something different from Router 1. It also can’t be an IP currently assigned to another device. 16. Configure Router 2's Wi-Fi name and passkey. They should be identical to Router 1. You should find these settings under a menu called “Wireless”, “Wi-Fi setup”, or something similar If you’re unsure of Router 1’s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device. Router 2 is not a wireless router, skip this step. 17. Disconnect the power from Router 2. Now that Router 2’s all set up, it’s a good idea to give it a restart—though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on. 18. Connect the first router to the second router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to a LAN port on Router 1. Then connect to the first LAN port on Router 2. Make sure you’re not plugging it into the WAN port as they look similar. 19. Plug Router 2 back in and turn it on. When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online. 20. Restart the computer that’s connected to Router 2. Anytime you connect a computer to a new network device, it's a good idea to restart your computer. 21. Connect other computers and devices. This can be done wirelessly , or by connecting Ethernet cables to unused LAN ports on either router. Router 1’s DHCP server will automatically assign each device its own IP address in the same subnet. Enjoy your expanded network!",

Connect your computer or mobile device directly to the second router via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable. You'll need to access its configuration page.\n**Step 3: Access the Second Router's Settings**\nOpen a web browser and type in the second router's default IP address (often found on a sticker on the router, or in its manual). Common default IPs include 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.2.1. Log in with the default username and password.\n**Step 4: Change the Second Router's IP Address**\nNavigate to the LAN settings or Network settings. Change the second router's IP address to one that is on the same subnet as your main router but outside its DHCP range (e.g., if your main router is 192.168.1.1 and its DHCP range is 192.168.1.100-1.199, you could set the second router to 192.168.1.2). Make sure this IP address is not already in use.\n**Step 5: Disable DHCP on the Second Router**\nIn the second router's settings, find the DHCP server option and disable it. This is crucial to prevent IP address conflicts with your main router's DHCP server.\n**Step 6: Connect the Routers**\nNow, connect an Ethernet cable from one of the LAN ports on your **main router** to a LAN port (not the WAN/Internet port) on the **second router**.\n",

Here are the steps to connect one router to another:\n\n### Step 1: Gather the Necessary Equipment\n- Two routers (one to be connected and one to be the main router)\n- Ethernet cables\n- Power adapters for both routers\n- A computer or device with internet access\n\n### Step 2: Configure the Main Router\n1. **Log in to the Main Router:**\n   - Connect your computer to the main router using an Ethernet cable.\n   - Open a web browser and type the IP address of the main router in the address bar. The default IP address is usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. If it doesn't work, try 192.168.1.254 or 192.168.2.1.\n   - Enter the default username and password, which is often \"admin\" for both the username and password.\n\n2. **Change the IP Address:**\n   - In the router's configuration page, look for the \"DHCP\" or \"IP Address\" settings.\n   - Change the IP address of the main router to avoid conflicts with the connected router. For example, if the main router is originally 192.168.0.1, change it to 192.168.1.1.\n\n3. **Save the Changes:**\n   - Click \"Apply\" or \"Save\" to save the changes.\n\n### Step 3: Connect the Routers\n1. **Connect the Routers:**\n   - Use an Ethernet cable to connect the LAN port of the main router to the WAN port of the connected router.\n   - Connect the power adapters to both routers and turn them on.\n\n### Step 4: Configure the Connected Router\n1. **Log in to the Connected Router:**\n   - Connect your computer to the connected router using an Ethernet cable.\n   - Open a web browser and type the IP address of the connected router in the address bar. The default IP address is usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. If it doesn't work, try 192.168.1.254 or 192.168.2.1.\n   - Enter the default username and password, which is often \"admin\" for both the username and password.\n\n2. **Change the IP Address:**\n   - In the router's configuration page, look for the \"DHCP\" or \"IP Address\" settings.\n   - Change the IP address of the connected router to avoid conflicts with the main router. For example, if the connected router is originally 192.168.0.1, change it to 192.168.1.2.\n\n3. **Set Up the Connected Router:**\n   - Configure the connected router as needed, such as setting up a wireless network, configuring parental controls, and setting up port forwarding if necessary.\n\n4. **Save the Changes:**\n   - Click \"Apply\" or \"Save\" to save the changes.\n\n### Step 5: Test the Connection\n1. **Check the Internet Connection:**\n   - Open a web browser and try to access a website. If the website loads, the connection is successful.\n\n2. **Check the Network:**\n   - Use a network scanner or app to check the network devices and ensure that both routers are connected and functioning properly.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- Use a consistent naming convention for your routers to avoid confusion.\n- Consider using a router with a built-in firewall to enhance security.\n- If you have a large network, you may need to configure additional settings, such as setting up a network of routers or using a mesh network system.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to connect one router to another and expand your network.",

    "text_ref": "1. Go to the blank page in your document. If a strange blank page appears in the middle of your Word document, it's likely due to an unintentional page break or extra paragraph markers that you can't see. 2. Press Ctrl + ⇧ Shift + 8 on Windows or ⌘ Cmd + 8 on Mac. This displays paragraph markers (¶) at the beginning of each blank line, as well as at the end of every paragraph. If there are any page breaks on this page, you'll see them marked by dotted lines and the word \"Page Break.\" [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source 3. Look for a small black square next to a paragraph marker. You'll want to look for this on both the blank page and the page after it. If you see a paragraph marker with a black square beside it, the paragraph has the \"Page break before\" setting turned on. You'll want to turn this off. To do so: Click the Home tab at the top of Word. Right-click the paragraph marker ¶ that has the corresponding black bullet point. Select Paragraph… on the menu. Click the Lines and Page Breaks tab. Remove the check next to \"Page break before\" (if there is one) and click OK . 4. Highlight the ¶ marks and/or Page Break lines with your mouse. If you see both (or more than one of each), highlight them all at once. Also, check the page right before your blank one for extra page breaks and delete those as well. Don't select paragraph markers that appear on lines that contain actual content. 5. Hit the Delete key. This should delete all the ¶ marks and page breaks, which should delete the blank page. If the blank page is still there, double-check the pages before for page breaks. 6. Press Ctrl + ⇧ Shift + 8 on Windows or ⌘ Cmd + 8 on Mac again. This hides the paragraph markers again. [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source If this method didn't work for you, try using the Deleting a Page with Content method.",

This will display all non-printing characters, including paragraph marks (¶), spaces (·), and page breaks.\n    \n\n\n2.  **Identify and Delete Extra Paragraph Marks:**\n    Scroll to the blank page. If you see several paragraph marks (¶) on the blank page, select them and press the `Delete` or `Backspace` key on your keyboard.\n     of an empty paragraph marks in word, with an arrow showing the selection and deletion of the marks.\n\n\n3.  **Delete Page Breaks:**\n    If the blank page has a \"Page Break\" or \"Section Break (Next Page)\" shown, place your cursor before the break and press `Delete`.\n     An image showing the deletion of a page break in a Word document, with a highlighted \"Page Break\" and an arrow pointing to the action.\n\n**Method 2: Reducing Paragraph Spacing (If the blank page is at the end)**\n\nSometimes a blank page at the end of a document is caused by too much spacing in the last paragraph.\n\n1.  **Select the last paragraph:** Go to the last paragraph of your document before the blank page.\n2.  **Adjust Paragraph Settings:** Go to the \"Layout\" (or \"Page Layout\") tab, and in the \"Paragraph\" group, look at the \"Spacing\" options, specifically \"After.\" Reduce the value to `0 pt` or a lower number.\n     Image of Word's \"Layout\" tab, with the \"Paragraph\" group highlighted, specifically the \"Spacing\" section where \"After\" spacing is being adjusted to reduce a blank page.\n\n**Method 3: Deleting a Section Break (Next Page) or Odd/Even Page**\n\nIf the blank page is caused by a section break that forces the next content to an odd or even page, you can delete the section break.\n\n1.  **Show Paragraph Marks:** (As in Method 1, Step 1)\n2.  **Locate Section Break:** Find the \"Section Break (Next Page)\", \"Section Break (Odd Page)\", or \"Section Break (Even Page)\" that precedes the blank page.\n3.  **Delete Section Break:** Place your cursor directly before the section break and press `Delete`.\n    Image showing a \"Section Break (Next Page)\" in a Word document, with a cursor placed before it and an arrow indicating to delete the break.",

This method works for all modern versions of Word beginning with Word 2016. You can also use it as a guide for earlier versions of Windows, although there will be fewer tools and features. Changing the background is done through a different method, using the Design tab. [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source 2. Click the Insert tab. It's near the top of Word between \"Home\" and \"Draw\" (or \"Home\" and \"Design\" in some versions). 3. Click the Pictures tool. It's in the \"Illustrations\" section of the toolbar running along the top of Word. Some location options will appear. If you're using Word 2019 or later, a menu will expand. If you're using Word 2016 or earlier, your file browser will appear. 4. Select the type of image you want to insert. The options are in the drop-down menu. You can choose an image on your computer, a stock image from Microsoft, or an image from the internet. Word 2019 or later: Click This Device if the picture is on your computer. Click Stock Images to select a free stock image from Microsoft's collection. Click Online Pictures to use Bing's image search to find photos on the web. If the photo is on your OneDrive, select Online Pictures and click OneDrive at the bottom-left corner. Word 2016: If the picture is on your computer, simply navigate to it in the file browser. If you want to search for a photo online or insert one from Facebook, Flickr, or your OneDrive, close the file browser and click the Online Pictures icon next to the \"Pictures\" in the toolbar. You can then select an image from Bing image search, Flickr, or Facebook. If the picture is on your OneDrive, click Online Pictures instead of Pictures and click Browse next to \"OneDrive.\" 5. Select the image you want to insert. When you find the picture, click it once to select it. If you're selecting from stock images or online images, you can click multiple pictures to add more than one. If you're choosing files from your computer and want to add more than one picture, hold the Ctrl button down as you click each image. 6. Click Insert . It'll be near the bottom-right corner of the window, no matter where you've selected your image(s). You’re done! Continue to the next steps for formatting information, or print the document when you’re ready. [6] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Alternatively, you can drag and drop the image file onto your document. 7. Resize the picture. If you want to change the picture's size, click it once to select it, and then drag any of the corner circles in or out. [7] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source You can also specify the size if you want. Double-click the picture to open the Picture Format tab at the top, and then set your desired measurements next to \"Height\" and \"Width.\" 8. Use the curved arrow at the top of the picture to rotate it. It's above the dot at the top-center part of the picture. To rotate, place the mouse cursor over the curved arrow, and then click and drag the cursor left or right until you're satisfied. 9. Double-click the picture to access more editing tools. This opens the \"Picture Format\" (2019 and later) or \"Format\" (2016) tab at the top of Word. On this tab, you can: In the \"Arrange\" panel in the top-right area, click Wrap Text to choose how to situate the picture in blocks of text. You can also set alignment preferences here. Wrapping the text is a good way to get your document formatted exactly the way you want. To crop the picture, click the Crop tool in the \"Size\" panel at the top-right corner. The \"Adjust\" panel near the top-left corner has additional tools for background removal, color effects, and corrections. To add a border or effect around the picture, select one of the \"Picture Styles\" at the center of the Format bar, or choose any of the other options in the section to have more control over the style.",

If you aren't sure if your printer has Wi-Fi or AirPrint capabilities, you can check the manual that came with it or you can check Apple's list of AirPrint printers . 2. Plug your printer into a power source. Use the power cable that came with your printer or one that's compatible. 3. Power on your printer. If the printer doesn't turn on automatically when plugged in, press the power button to turn it on. You can usually find the power button on the front face or on the back near the power cable. 4. Navigate to your printer's wireless network settings. Most modern printers have a built-in display that you can use to navigate various menus. The location of the wireless settings varies by printer, but you'll usually find it in a menu called Settings or Manage . If your printer does not have a built-in display, consult your manual to learn how to connect it to your wireless network. People using HP AirPrint printers without a built-in display need to press and hold the \"Wireless\" and \"Cancel\" buttons at the same time until the \"Power\" and \"Wireless\" lights flash. If you can't find your printer's wireless settings, you can add the printer on a Mac by clicking the Apple menu, navigating to System Preferences > Print & Scan , and then clicking + to add the printer. 5. Select your Wi-Fi network on the printer. Once you find the wireless settings, the printer should start scanning for wireless access points it can connect to. Select the SSID of your wireless router (usually found on the bottom or back of the router), and then enter the Wi-Fi password if required. If you don't see the Wi-Fi network you're looking for, you may need to move the printer closer to the router. If your printer does not have a touch screen, use the hardware buttons to enter the password. Wi-Fi passwords are typically case-sensitive, so make sure you use proper capitalization. 6. Connect your computer, phone, or tablet to the same Wi-Fi network. Once you've connected the AirPrint printer to your Wi-Fi network, it will show up as a printer on any device (like your iPhone) as long the device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network.",

If you have any files stored on your flash drive, transfer the data to a computer. Formatting a flash drive will delete all its contents and give it a new file system. 2. Open the File Explorer and click This PC . You can find this option in the left panel, next to a monitor icon. On Windows 7, click Computer on the right side of the Start window. 3. Right-click the flash drive's icon. It's beneath the \"Devices and drives\" heading in the middle of the page. This will bring up a drop-down menu. 4. Click Format… . This option is near the middle of the drop-down menu. Doing so opens the Format window. 5. Click the \"File System\" box. It's below the \"File System\" heading near the top of the page. A drop-down menu will appear with the following options: NTFS - The default Windows operating system format. If you're using your drive as a secondary Windows drive, you'll need to choose this option. FAT32 - The most widely compatible format. Works with most computers and gaming consoles. exFAT - Similar to FAT32 , but designed for external hard drives (e.g., flash drives) and quicker use. It's a universal format that is most common across Windows, Linux, and Mac. 6. Click a format option. The option you pick will depend on what you plan on using the drive for. For example, choose FAT32 if you're formatting the flash drive for use with a gaming console , or choose NTFS if you're creating a Windows-only backup drive . If you've formatted your drive before and you're positive that it isn't broken, you can also check the Quick Format box. 7. Click Start , then click OK . Windows will begin formatting the flash drive. 8. Click OK when prompted. Your flash drive has successfully been formatted. 9. Connect the USB flash drive to your computer. To do so, plug it into one of your Mac's USB ports, which resemble thin, rectangular slots on your computer's housing. Formatting a flash drive will delete all its contents and give it a new file system. Be sure to transfer any files to your computer or a new USB if you want to keep them. Some Macs don't have USB ports, so you'll need to purchase an adapter. 10. Click Go . It's a menu item in the top-left side of the menu bar. If you don't see Go , you can use the Finder , which resembles a blue face in your Mac's dock. 11. Click Utilities . This option is in the Go drop-down menu. 12. Double-click Disk Utility . You'll likely find this option in the middle of the Utilities page. 13. Click your flash drive's name. It's on the far-left side of the Disk Utility window. 14. Click the Erase tab. This option is at the top of the Disk Utility window. 15. Click the \"Format\" box. It's in the middle of the page. This will bring up a drop-down menu with the following options: Mac OS Extended (Journaled) Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled) Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted) MS-DOS (FAT) ExFAT 16. Click a format option. You'll generally use one of the Mac OS options for a Mac-only flash drive (e.g., a backup drive), though you'd choose MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFat for greater compatibility. 17. Click Erase , then click Erase again when prompted. This will begin the formatting process. Once the formatting is complete, you'll see an icon for your flash drive appear on your Mac's desktop.",

    "Gemini_text": "### How to Format a USB Flash Drive\n\nFormatting a USB flash drive essentially prepares it for use by a computer's operating system. It deletes all existing data and sets up a new file system.\n\n**Step 1: Connect the USB Drive**\nPlug your USB flash drive into an available USB port on your computer. Make sure it's securely connected.\n\n**Step 2: Open \"This PC\" (Windows) or \"Finder\" (Mac)**\n*   **Windows:** Open File Explorer (you can usually do this by clicking the folder icon on your taskbar or pressing `Windows key + E`). Then, click on \"This PC\" in the left-hand pane.\n*   **Mac:** Open Finder from your dock. Your USB drive should appear under \"Locations\" or \"Devices\" in the sidebar.\n\n**Step 3: Locate Your USB Drive**\nIn \"This PC\" or \"Finder,\" you will see a list of your computer's drives. Identify your USB flash drive. It will usually be labeled with a drive letter (e.g., E:, F:) and might have a name like \"USB Drive\" or \"Removable Disk.\" Make sure you select the correct drive, as formatting the wrong one will erase its data.\n\n**Step 4: Right-Click and Select \"Format\"**\n*   **Windows:** Right-click on your USB drive. A context menu will appear. Select \"Format...\"\n\n*   **Mac:** Right-click (or Control-click) on your USB drive and select \"Erase...\" This will open Disk Utility.\n\n**Step 5: Configure Format Options**\n*   **Windows:**\n    *   **File system:** Choose a file system.\n        *   **FAT32:** Compatible with almost all devices (Windows, Mac, Linux, smart TVs, gaming consoles). Good for smaller drives (under 32GB) or when maximum compatibility is needed.\n        *   **NTFS:** Best for Windows computers, supports larger files and drives, and offers better security features.\n        *   **exFAT:** A good option for larger drives (over 32GB) and compatible with both Windows and Mac, without the file size limitations of FAT32.\n    *   **Allocation unit size:** Usually, \"Default allocation size\" is fine.\n    *   **Volume label:** You can type a new name for your USB drive here.\n    *   **Quick Format:** Leave this checked for a faster format. Unchecking it performs a more thorough (and slower) format that also checks for bad sectors.\n\n*   **Mac (Disk Utility):**\n    *   **Name:** Give your USB drive a new name.\n    *   **Format:** Choose a format.\n        *   **APFS:** Apple File System, best for macOS 10.13 or later.\n        *   **Mac OS Extended (Journaled):** HFS+, good for older macOS versions.\n        *   **MS-DOS (FAT):** Equivalent to FAT32, for maximum compatibility.\n        *   **ExFAT:** For larger drives and cross-platform compatibility.\n    *   **Scheme:** Choose \"GUID Partition Map\" for Intel/Apple Silicon Macs, or \"Master Boot Record\" for wider compatibility with older systems or Windows.\n\n**Step 6: Start the Formatting Process**\n*   **Windows:** Click the \"Start\" button. You'll get a warning that all data on the drive will be erased. Click \"OK\" to proceed.\n*   **Mac:** Click the \"Erase\" button. You'll be asked to confirm. Click \"Erase\" again.\n\n**Step 7: Wait for Completion**\nThe formatting process will begin. It usually takes only a few seconds or minutes, depending on the drive size and whether you performed a quick format.\n\n**Step 8: Close the Dialog Box**\nOnce the format is complete, you'll receive a notification. Click \"OK\" or \"Done\" to close the formatting window. Your USB drive is now formatted and ready to use!\n\n---\n\nHere's a visual representation of the general steps involved:\n\n",

Make sure the drive is recognized by the computer.\n\n2. **Open File Explorer**: Open File Explorer on your computer. You can do this by clicking on the Start button and then selecting File Explorer from the list of programs.\n\n3. **Locate the USB Flash Drive**: In File Explorer, navigate to the USB flash drive. It will usually be listed under the \"This PC\" section. You can also use the search bar at the top of File Explorer to search for the USB flash drive.\n\n4. **Right-Click on the USB Flash Drive**: Right-click on the USB flash drive in File Explorer and select \"Format\" from the context menu.\n\n5. **Select the File System**: In the Format window, select the file system you want to use for the USB flash drive. The most common file systems are NTFS, exFAT, and FAT32. NTFS is the default file system for Windows computers, while exFAT and FAT32 are more compatible with other operating systems.\n\n6. **Select the Allocation Unit Size**: Choose the allocation unit size. This determines the size of each file or folder on the USB flash drive. The default setting is usually fine, but you can adjust it if you want to optimize the performance of the drive.\n\n7. **Check the Quick Format Box**: Check the \"Quick Format\" box. This option will format the USB flash drive quickly, but it may not erase all the data on the drive. If you want to ensure that all data is erased, uncheck the \"Quick Format\" box and select \"Full Format\" instead.\n\n8. **Click \"Start\"**: Click \"Start\" to begin the formatting process. The USB flash drive will be formatted according to the settings you selected.\n\n9. **Wait for the Formatting to Complete**: The formatting process may take a few minutes, depending on the size of the USB flash drive and the speed of your computer. Once the process is complete, you will see a confirmation message.\n\n10. **Eject the USB Flash Drive**: Once the formatting is complete, you can safely eject the USB flash drive from your computer. Right-click on the USB flash drive in File Explorer and select \"Eject\" from the context menu.\n\nThat's it! Your USB flash drive is now formatted and ready to use.",

You have three options:\n     - **Entire Screen:** This option will share your entire computer screen with others in the meeting.\n     - **Application Window:** This option allows you to select a specific application window to share. You can choose from the list of open applications.\n     - **Desktop:** This option will share your desktop, which includes all your open windows and applications.\n\n4. **Select the Screen or Application:**\n   - If you choose \"Entire Screen\" or \"Desktop,\" you'll see a preview of what will be shared. If you choose \"Application Window,\" select the application you want to share from the list.\n\n5. **Start Sharing:**\n   - Click on the \"Share Screen\" button to start sharing your screen. A confirmation message will appear, indicating that your screen is being shared.\n\n6. **Stop Sharing:**\n   - To stop sharing your screen, click on the \"Stop Share Screen\" button. This will end the screen sharing session.\n\n7. **Additional Tips:**\n   - You can also use the \"Full Screen\" button to maximize the screen you're sharing.\n   - If you're sharing an application window, you can resize it by dragging the edges of the window.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily share your screen on Zoom and present your computer's content to others in a meeting.",

    "prompt": "How to install a browser extension in Chrome? Use steps with screenshots and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Go to https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions in Chrome. No matter which type of computer you have, you can find a variety of extensions to add to Google Chrome at the Chrome Web Store. You can also add Chrome extensions to other browsers built on Chromium, including Microsoft Edge , Opera , and Brave . While Chrome extensions aren't available for Chrome on Android, iPhone, or iPad, you can install some extensions in the Kiwi Browser for Android using these same steps. 2. Search for an extension. If you know the name of the extension you want to install, type it into the \"Search the store\" field at the top-right, then press Enter or Return to search. You can also search for a type of extension, such as \" ad blocker \" or \"calendar,\" or browse by category using the tabs on the left side of the page. If you downloaded an extension from outside of the Chrome Web Store, see this method to learn how to install it. 3. Click an extension to check it out. You'll now be able to see the extension's name, some screenshots, ratings, and reviews. Before downloading the extension, it's best to read reviews to make sure users are satisfied. You can also click the Privacy practices tab at the top of the extension's page to see what type of personal information the extension will collect from you. 4. Click Add to Chrome to install. You'll see this blue button near the top-right corner of the page. A confirmation pop-up will appear. 5. Click Add extension to confirm. This adds the extension to Chrome. To see your installed extensions, click the puzzle piece icon at the top-right corner of Chrome. Read on to learn how to use extensions and pin them to your toolbar. 6. Click the puzzle piece icon at the top-right corner of Chrome. It's to the right of the address bar at the top of the browser window. This is where you'll find all of your installed Chrome extensions. 7. Click an extension to launch it. Each extension is different, so what happens next will vary. Some extensions will instantly perform a task, while others will display options that you can modify. You can also click the three-dot menu next to an extension to access its options and permissions. 8. Pin an extension to the toolbar. If you use an extension often, you can pin its icon to the Chrome toolbar to make it easier to find. Here's how: Click the puzzle piece icon at the top-right corner to view installed extensions. Any extensions that are already pinned to the toolbar will have a blue-filled pushpin icon. Extensions that aren't pinned have empty pushpin icons. Click an empty pushpin icon next to an extension to pin that extension to the toolbar. This fills the pushpin with blue and adds an icon for the extension to the upper-right corner of Chrome. If there are certain extensions you use less often, you can unpin them from the taskbar. Just click the puzzle piece icon, then click the blue pushpin next to an extension to unpin it. You can still launch the extension by clicking its name in the puzzle piece menu. 9. Click the puzzle piece icon at the top-right corner of Chrome. Many extensions have options and preferences that you can manage. Start by clicking the puzzle piece menu to view your extensions. If you don't see the toolbar at the top of Chrome, you might be in full-screen mode. Press F11 (PC), F4 (Chromebook), or Ctrl + Cmd + F (Mac) to toggle off full-screen mode. 10. Click Manage extensions . It's at the bottom of the puzzle piece menu. Now you'll see all of your installed extensions. You can also get here by typing chrome://extensions in the address bar and pressing Enter or Return . 11. Click Details on an extension. This displays the extension's details, including its size and version, a description, permissions, and additional options. 12. Adjust the extension's access and options. The options you can adjust for each extension will vary, but you can usually change: Site access: This section tells you which sites the extension has permission to read and modify your data. For example, if you're using a translation extension , you'll want to give it access On all sites so you can translate websites on the fly. Allow in incognito: By default, extensions are disabled in incognito mode . If you want to be able to use this extension incognito, you can click the switch. Extension options: Many extensions also have different settings you can customize. If you see this option, click it to modify the extension or access your preferences. 13. Click the puzzle piece icon at the top-right corner of Chrome. If you don't want to use an extension anymore, you can either disable it or delete it entirely. 14. Click Manage extensions . It's at the bottom of the puzzle piece menu. You'll see all of your installed extensions. 15. Use the switch to enable or disable an extension. If you don't want an extension to load in Chrome but don't want to delete it entirely, you can toggle the extension's switch to the Off position. You can then turn it back on at any time by moving the switch back to On. 16. Delete an extension. If you don't want to use an extension at all anymore, click Remove below the extension's name, then click Remove again to confirm. 17. Click the puzzle piece icon at the top-right corner of Chrome. If you need to install an extension that isn't available in the Chrome Web Store, such as extensions from Github, you can do so in Chrome Developer Mode. Be careful when downloading extensions from outside of the Chrome store, as such extensions are not vetted by Google. 18. Click Manage extensions . It's at the bottom of the puzzle piece menu. 19. Toggle on the \"Developer mode\" switch . You'll see it at the top-right corner. Once enabled, you can add extensions from other sources to Chrome. 20. Click Load unpacked . It's at the top-left corner. 21. Select the folder containing your Chrome extension. If you downloaded the extension as a ZIP file, you'll need to unzip it first . Once selected, the extension will be added to Chrome. You can now manage the extension as you would any other extension.",

Here's a step-by-step guide with screenshots:\n\n**Step 1: Open Chrome and Navigate to the Chrome Web Store**\nFirst, open your Chrome browser. You can get to the Chrome Web Store in a couple of ways:\n\n*   **Directly:** Go to the Chrome Web Store website: `https://chrome.google.com/webstore`\n*   **Via Settings:** Click the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner of Chrome, go to \"More tools,\" and then select \"Extensions.\" On the Extensions page, you'll see a link to the \"Chrome Web Store.\"\n\n**Step 2: Search for the Extension**\nOnce you're in the Chrome Web Store, you'll see a search bar on the left side. Type the name of the extension you want to install (e.g., \"AdBlock,\" \"Grammarly,\" or \"LastPass\") and press Enter.\n\n**Step 3: Select the Extension**\nFrom the search results, click on the extension you wish to install. This will take you to the extension's dedicated page, where you can read more about it, see reviews, and view screenshots.\n\n**Step 4: Add to Chrome**\nOn the extension's page, click the blue \"Add to Chrome\" button.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm Installation**\nA pop-up window will appear, asking you to confirm if you want to \"Add [Extension Name]?\" It will also list the permissions the extension requires. Review these permissions and, if you agree, click \"Add extension.\"\n\n**Step 6: Use Your New Extension**\nOnce the extension is installed, you'll usually see its icon appear in the top-right corner of your Chrome browser, next to the address bar. Sometimes, a welcome tab will open with instructions on how to use it. You can click on the extension icon to access its features and settings.\n\n",

You can do this by typing \"chrome web store\" in your browser's address bar and pressing Enter, or by clicking on the Chrome Web Store icon in your browser's toolbar.\n\n2. **Search for the Extension**: Once you are on the Chrome Web Store, you can search for the extension you want to install. You can do this by typing the name of the extension in the search bar at the top of the page.\n\n3. **Select the Extension**: When you find the extension you want to install, click on its name to go to its page. This will give you more information about the extension, including its description, reviews, and screenshots.\n\n4. **Click \"Add to Chrome\"**: On the extension's page, you will see a button that says \"Add to Chrome\". Click this button to add the extension to your browser.\n\n5. **Confirm the Installation**: A pop-up window will appear asking you to confirm that you want to add the extension. Click \"Add extension\" to confirm.\n\n6. **Wait for the Installation**: The extension will be installed and added to your browser. You may need to restart Chrome for the changes to take effect.\n\n7. **Access the Extension**: Once the extension is installed, you can access it by clicking on the extension's icon in the top right corner of your browser. This will open the extension's interface, where you can configure its settings and use its features.\n\nHere are some screenshots to help you through the process:\n\n1. **Opening the Chrome Web Store**:\n   - Image: A screenshot of the Chrome Web Store page with the search bar at the top.\n   - Text: \"Open Chrome Web Store\"\n\n2. **Searching for the Extension**:\n   - Image: A screenshot of the Chrome Web Store page with the search bar and a search query entered.\n   - Text: \"Search for the Extension\"\n\n3. **Selecting the Extension**:\n   - Image: A screenshot of the Chrome Web Store page with the extension's name and description.\n   - Text: \"Select the Extension\"\n\n4. **Clicking \"Add to Chrome\"**:\n   - Image: A screenshot of the Chrome Web Store page with the \"Add to Chrome\" button highlighted.\n   - Text: \"Click 'Add to Chrome'\"\n\n5. **Confirming the Installation**:\n   - Image: A screenshot of the pop-up window asking to confirm the installation.\n   - Text: \"Confirm the Installation\"\n\n6. **Waiting for the Installation**:\n   - Image: A screenshot of the Chrome Web Store page with the \"Add to Chrome\" button no longer visible.\n   - Text: \"Wait for the Installation\"\n\n7. **Accessing the Extension**:\n   - Image: A screenshot of the Chrome browser with the extension's icon in the top right corner.\n   - Text: \"Access the Extension\"\n\nI hope this helps!

This method will work on the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, XR, XS, XS Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and iPhone SE (2nd Generation). 2. Press and release the Volume Down button. It's on the left side of the phone below the Volume Up button. 3. Press and hold the side button. It's on the right side of the phone. Continue holding the button until the Apple logo appears. 4. Release your finger once the Apple logo appears. This should force-restart your unresponsive iPhone. If your iPhone still won't restart, try charging it for an hour and then trying again. If you still can't restart your iPhone, see Fixing an iPhone that Won't Force-Restart . 5. Press and hold the Volume Down button and Sleep/Wake button. The Volume Down button is on the left side of the iPhone, and the Sleep/Wake button is on the top-most edge. Continue holding these buttons down until the Apple logo appears. 6. Release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. If the reset was successful, your iPhone will restart normally. If your iPhone still won't restart, try charging it for an hour and then trying again. If you still can't restart your iPhone, see Fixing an iPhone that Won't Force-Restart . 7. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button. The Sleep/Wake button is on the top-most edge of the iPhone, while the Home button is the large round button at the bottom-center part of the screen. Continue holding the buttons down until you see the Apple logo. 8. Release the buttons when the Apple logo appears. Your iPhone should restart normally if the reset was successful. If your iPhone still won't restart, try charging it for an hour and then trying again. If you still can't restart your iPhone, see Fixing an iPhone that Won't Force-Restart . 9. Connect your iPhone to a computer. If your iPhone gets hung up on the Apple logo or a solid-color screen when forcing it to restart, you can try using your PC or Mac to repair it without losing data. Start by connecting the iPhone to the computer using its charging cable. 10. Open Finder (Mac) or iTunes (PC). If you're using Mac Catalina or later, click the two-toned face on the Dock to launch Finder. If you have Windows or an earlier version of macOS, open iTunes from the Start menu or Applications folder. 11. Locate your iPhone. If you're using Finder, click your iPhone's name in the left panel under \"Locations.\" If you're using iTunes, click the button with an iPhone icon near the top-left corner of the app (to the right of the drop-down menu). 12. Put your iPhone into recovery mode . The steps to do this vary by model: Models with Face ID: Press and release the Volume Up button, then press and release the Volume Down button. Press and hold the button on the top edge until your iPhone restarts in recovery mode. iPhone 8 or Later: Press and release the Volume Up button, then press and release the Volume Down button. Press and hold the button on the right side until the iPhone boots into recovery mode. iPhone 7/7 Plus: Press and hold the top button (or right-side button on some models) and the Volume Down buttons at the same time. Lift your fingers when the phone boots into recovery mode. iPhones with Home buttons, iPhone 6, and earlier: Press and hold the Home button and the top (or right-side) buttons at the same time. Lift your fingers when the recovery mode screen appears. 13. Click the Update button on your computer. This button is on the pop-up message that appeared in Finder or iTunes when the iPhone went into recovery mode. Choosing this option attempts to repair iOS without deleting your data. If this process fixes the iPhone, it will restart as normal. If it takes longer than 15 minutes to download the update, the iPhone will exit recovery mode automatically. In this case, repeat Step 4 to get back into recovery mode and then try again. If updating the iPhone was successful but you still can't use it, you may have success with a factory reset. Just repeat this method and select Restore instead of Update . This will erase all of the data on your iPhone, so do this as a last resort. 14. Contact Apple Support if your iPhone still won't restart. Apple recommends contacting their support team if you continue to experience any of these issues: The screen remains black or another solid color, the screen comes on but the iPhone won't respond to your touch, or the iPhone remains stuck on the Apple logo. To reach out for support, visit https://getsupport.apple.com , select your model, and follow the on-screen instructions.",

For older iPhones (iPhone 8 or earlier), you'll typically use the side or top button.\n**Step 2: Press and Hold the Buttons**\nFor iPhones with Face ID (iPhone X and later): Press and hold the side button and either volume button simultaneously until the \"slide to power off\" slider appears.\nFor iPhones with a Home button (iPhone 8 or earlier): Press and hold the side (or top) button until the \"slide to power off\" slider appears.\n**Step 3: Slide to Power Off**\nDrag the slider to the right. Your iPhone will power down completely.\n**Step 4: Turn Your iPhone Back On**\nOnce your iPhone is completely off, press and hold the side button (or top button for older models) again until you see the Apple logo appear.

    "text_ref": "1. Go to https://accounts.google.com in a browser. This will open the Google Account sign-in page. If you already have a Google account, you’ll need to sign out before you can continue. 2. Click Create account . You’ll find this small blue link near the bottom of the page, next to the Next button. 3. Select your account type from the menu. A menu will pop up with a few options to choose from. Select either For my personal use , For my child , or For work or my business . If you’re trying to create a business account, you might want to consider signing up for a Google Workspace account instead. The process for creating a child’s account is very similar to creating a personal account for yourself. You’ll need to provide information such as your child’s name, birthdate, and desired email address. However, you’ll also need to sign in with your Gmail account to provide parental consent for their account. 4. Enter your first and last name. Type your first name into the \"First name\" text box, then enter your last name in the \"Last name\" box underneath it. You must enter a first name, but the last name is optional. If you're creating a Gmail account for a friend or a child, enter their information in the fields provided. 5. Enter your birth date and gender. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to provide your birthdate (month, day, and year) and gender. If you don’t identify as male or female, select Custom to see additional options. You can also select Rather not say . Click Next when you’re done. Google asks for your birthdate because some Google services have specific age requirements. Google may also use this information to personalize your experience. If you decide to provide your gender, Google will use this information to personalize your account—e.g., by using your preferred pronouns in text that refers to you. 6. Select or create a custom email address. On the next page, you’ll be offered some automatically generated email addresses based on your name. If you don’t want any of those, select Create your own Gmail address and type in your preferred username. You can use a combination of letters, numbers, and periods. This is the text that will appear before “@gmail.com” in your email address. Click Next when you’re done. You must enter a unique username that isn't being used by someone else. If it's taken, you'll see: That username is taken. Try another. If the username you want is taken, add a number at the end or change the spelling. Sometimes Google will reject a username if it’s extremely similar to one that somebody else is using (even if there are slight differences), if someone else had that username in the past and then deleted it, or if Google has reserved the name to prevent abuse or spam. 7. Enter and confirm your new password. Type your preferred password into the \"Password\" text box, then type the same password into the \"Confirm\" box underneath it. Check the Show password box to see what you are typing. Click Next when you’re done. These passwords must match before you can proceed. Make sure to use a strong password to avoid any unauthorized access to your account. 8. Enter a recovery email. Google will contact you at your recovery email address if something goes wrong with your new account—e.g. if you get locked out or Google detects unusual activity from your address. Click Next when you’re done. If you don’t have an alternate email, or if you’d rather set up recovery options later, click Skip . 9. Review your info and select Next . On the next page, you’ll see your new account name and email address. If it looks good, click Next . Otherwise, you can use your browser’s Back button to go back and make changes to the information you entered in the previous steps. 10. Agree to the Terms of Service. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to agree to Google’s terms and privacy policy. Once you’ve reviewed them, click I agree . If you change your mind, click Cancel instead. 11. Confirm your personalization options. A window will pop up asking if you want to agree to Google’s personalization options. Click Confirm to continue, or select More options to change your settings. 12. Customize your account settings. Once you verify your new address, you’ll be taken to the Google Account home page. From here, you can adjust settings such as: Your account recovery information. Add a recovery email here if you didn’t already, or add a phone number so you have two recovery options. Set a home address for a more personalized experience. For example, Google will show you weather reports and map results based on your address. Adjust your privacy and security settings and review privacy recommendations for your account. Add contacts or set up a family group. 13. Go to https://mail.google.com to access your Gmail. You should be automatically logged into your new account. If not, you’ll be prompted to sign in. The first time you visit this page, you’ll see options to customize your inbox, set a profile image, and add or import contacts. To write and send an email, click Compose in the top left corner. To see your emails, click the Inbox tab on the left side of the page. Use the tabs at the top of your inbox on the right to view different categories such as regular emails (in Primary ), marketing related emails (in Promotions ), or email notifications from various social media platforms (in Social ). In the menu on the left, you can also browse your drafts, sent emails, scheduled messages, your spam folder, and more. Adjust your settings by clicking the Settings icon at the top right side of the page. To sign out of your account, tap your initial or profile picture at the top right corner of the page, then select Sign Out .",

You'll typically see a \"Create account\" button.\n\n\n**Step 2: Enter Your First and Last Name**\n\nClick on \"Create account\" and then select \"For my personal use.\" You'll be prompted to enter your first and last name. Click \"Next\" when you're done.\n\n\n**Step 3: Provide Your Basic Information**\n\nEnter your birthdate (day, month, year) and select your gender from the dropdown menu. This information helps Google personalize your experience and ensure age appropriateness. Click \"Next.\"\n**Step 4: Choose Your Gmail Address**\n\nGoogle will suggest some email addresses based on your name. You can choose one of these or select \"Create your own Gmail address\" to type in a custom one. If your chosen address is already taken, you'll be prompted to try another. Click \"Next.\"\n\n\n**Step 5: Create a Strong Password**\n\nEnter a strong password that you'll remember but is difficult for others to guess. It should be a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Confirm your password by re-entering it. Click \"Next.\"\n\n\n**Step 6: Add a Recovery Phone Number (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nYou have the option to add a recovery phone number. This is highly recommended as it helps secure your account and recover it if you forget your password. You can skip this step if you prefer, but it's a good security measure. Click \"Next.\"\n\n\n**Step 7: Review Your Account Information**\n\nReview the information you've entered to ensure everything is correct. If you need to make any changes, you can go back.

    "text_ref": "1. Make sure Wi-Fi is turned on. You don't need to connect a network, but AirDrop uses point-to-point Wi-Fi to send data to someone else. If Wi-Fi is disabled, you'll need to turn it on. Go to Settings → Wi-Fi → toggle on Wi-Fi . 2. Bluetooth must be turned on to find other devices. If you're having trouble sending files, the Bluetooth connection could have been disabled during the transfer. Go to Settings → Bluetooth → toggle on Bluetooth . 3. You can't have a Personal Hotspot active when trying to AirDrop. You need your Bluetooth connectivity free while you complete the transfer. To turn off Hotspot, go to Settings → Personal Hotspot → toggle off Allow Others to Join . 4. Make sure both devices are unlocked. Use the passcode or Face ID to unlock the devices. For best results, leave the receiving device on the home page while the file sends. 5. Change AirDrop settings to \"Everyone\". If you have your settings set to Contacts only , you'll need to change this. Go to Settings → General → AirDrop → Everyone for 10 Minutes . Older versions of iOS will show Everyone . 6. AirDrop only has a range of about 30 feet. To ensure your files aren't getting lost over the connection, place the two devices next to each other. Make sure you're only sending to one device at a time. 7. Make sure both devices have access to AirDrop. You may have accidentally blocked its permissions. To change it, do the following: Open the Settings app. Tap Screen Time . Tap Content & Privacy Restrictions . Tap Allowed apps . Toggle on AirDrop . 8. Update both devices. Make sure you're running the latest update supported on your device. This could include major bug fixes. On iPhone , check for updates in Settings → General → Software Update . On Mac Ventura, click the Apple menu → System Settings → General → Software Update . On Mac Monterey and older, click the Apple menu → System Preferences → Software Update . 9. Try to restart your device and the receiving device. You may just need a simple reset to get your connection working. On iPhone X and newer, press and hold the side button and either volume button until the slider appears. Slide to power off. On iPhones with a home button, press and hold the side button until the slider appears. Wait a few seconds, then power on your device again. 10. Disable any active VPNs. Virtual Private Networks can interfere with your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. Temporarily disable your VPN, then try to AirDrop your file again. 11. Reset your network settings. If all else fails, this might be an issue with your network. Open the Settings app. Tap General . Tap Reset . Tap Reset Network Settings . 12. Consider a cloud service. If you need to send a large file, consider using a cloud service such as Apple iCloud , Google Drive , or Microsoft OneDrive . These can host larger files that can be accessed around the clock, which can be beneficial if you need to share with multiple people.",

You can usually find these settings in the Control Center (iOS/iPadOS) or the Menu Bar (macOS).\n\n\n\n**Step 3: Set AirDrop Receiving Settings**\n\nOn the receiving device, open Control Center (iOS/iPadOS) or Finder > AirDrop (macOS). Tap or click on \"AirDrop\" and ensure it's set to \"Contacts Only\" or \"Everyone.\" If it's set to \"Receiving Off,\" no one can send you files.\n\n**Step 4: Disable Personal Hotspot**\n\nIf you're using Personal Hotspot on either device, it can interfere with AirDrop.

Here are the steps to fix Apple AirDrop when it's not sending:\n\n### Step 1: Check AirDrop Settings\n1. **Open Settings** on your iPhone or iPad.\n2. **Tap on General**.\n3. **Tap on AirDrop**.\n4. **Ensure that AirDrop is set to \"Everyone\" or \"Contacts Only\"**. If it's set to \"No One\", AirDrop won't work.\n\n### Step 2: Restart Your Device\n1. **Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button** on your iPhone or iPad until the slider appears.\n2. **Drag the slider to turn off your device**.\n3. **Wait for 30 seconds**.\n4. **Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button again to turn your device back on**.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Software Updates\n1. **Open Settings** on your iPhone or iPad.\n2. **Tap on General**.\n3. **Tap on Software Update**.\n4. **Install any available updates**. Sometimes, a software update can fix issues with AirDrop.\n\n### Step 4: Restart AirDrop\n1. **Open the AirDrop app** on your iPhone or iPad.\n2. **Tap on the AirDrop icon** in the top left corner.\n3. **Select \"Done\"** to restart AirDrop.\n\n### Step 5: Check for Interference\n1. **Ensure that your device is not in a location with strong Wi-Fi or Bluetooth interference**. This can sometimes cause AirDrop issues.\n2. **Move to a different location** if you're in a crowded area or near other devices that might be using the same frequency.\n\n### Step 6: Reset Network Settings\n1. **Open Settings** on your iPhone or iPad.\n2. **Tap on General**.\n3. **Tap on Reset**.\n4. **Tap on Reset Network Settings**.\n5. **Enter your passcode** if prompted.\n6. **Wait for the process to complete**.\n\n### Step 7: Reset Your Device\n1. **Open Settings** on your iPhone or iPad.\n2. **Tap on General**.\n3. **Tap on Reset**.\n4. **Tap on Erase All Content and Settings**.\n5. **Enter your passcode** if prompted.\n6. **Wait for the process to complete**.\n\n### Step 8: Contact Apple Support\n1. **If none of the above steps work**, it might be a hardware issue. Contact Apple Support for further assistance.\n\nRemember, if you're experiencing issues with AirDrop on multiple devices, it's a good idea to check if the problem is with your device or if it's a broader issue with AirDrop.",

    "Bagel_text": "Creating a PDF from a Word document is a straightforward process that can be done using Microsoft Word itself or by using a third-party PDF converter. Here, I'll guide you through the process using Microsoft Word, which is the most common method.\n\n### Steps to Create a PDF from Word\n\n#### Method 1: Using Microsoft Word\n\n1. **Open Your Word Document:**\n   - Launch Microsoft Word on your computer.\n   - Open the Word document you want to convert to a PDF.\n\n2. **Go to File:**\n   - Click on the \"File\" tab in the top left corner of the Word window.\n\n3. **Select \"Save As\":**\n   - From the drop-down menu, select \"Save As.\"\n\n4. **Choose PDF as the File Type:**\n   - In the \"Save As\" dialog box, select \"PDF\" from the \"Save as type\" dropdown menu.\n\n5. **Customize Your PDF Settings:**\n   - You can customize the settings by clicking on the \"Options\" button. Here, you can choose the page layout, orientation, and other settings.\n\n6. **Save the PDF:**\n   - Click on the \"Save\" button to save your Word document as a PDF.\n\n#### Method 2: Using a Third-Party PDF Converter (e.g., Adobe Acrobat)\n\n1. **Download and Install Adobe Acrobat:**\n   - If you don't have Adobe Acrobat, download and install it from the Adobe website.\n\n2. **Open Adobe Acrobat:**\n   - Launch Adobe Acrobat on your computer.\n\n3. **Open Your Word Document:**\n   - Click on \"File\" and then \"Open\" to select your Word document.\n\n4. **Convert to PDF:**\n   - Once your document is open, click on \"File\" and then \"Save As.\"\n   - In the \"Save As\" dialog box, select \"PDF\" from the \"Save as type\" dropdown menu.\n\n5. **Customize Your PDF Settings:**\n   - You can customize the settings by clicking on the \"Options\" button. Here, you can choose the page layout, orientation, and other settings.\n\n6. **Save the PDF:**\n   - Click on the \"Save\" button to save your Word document as a PDF.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Use the \"Print\" Option:**\n  - Another way to create a PDF from Word is to use the \"Print\" option. Go to \"File\" > \"Print\" and then select \"Microsoft Print to PDF\" as the printer. This method is useful if you want to create a PDF without saving the file in Word.\n\n- **Use Online PDF Converters:**\n  - If you don't have Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat, you can use online PDF converters like SmallPDF, Adobe Online Services, or any other online tool that offers this functionality.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily create a PDF from your Word document.",

    "text_ref": "1. Open your Settings app. The app has a gray icon with a gear on it. You can use this method to check your battery health on any iPad model, including iPad Pro and iPad Air. 2. Navigate to Privacy & Security . You will have to scroll a bit to find this option, as it's at the bottom of the section that begins with General . 3. Click on Analytics & Improvements . It's near the bottom of the screen. 4. Ensure Share iPad Analytics is toggled. If this setting isn't toggled on, your iPad will not generate the logs needed to decipher your battery health. If you just toggled this setting on now, you'll need to wait a minimum of 24 hours for your iPad to create the correct analytics log. 5. Click on Analytics Data . A list of logs should pop up. 6. Find the most recent Analytics log. You are looking for a log that is titled Analytics . The numbers after Analytics are a date, so select the one that is the most recent. Logs titled analyticsd.diskwrites will not work for this method. If you're on iOS 15 or earlier, the correct analytics log will be titled log-aggregated . 7. Copy the log into a text editor. You can use the Notes app on your iPad or you can export the log file to a computer. 8. Search for MaximumCapacityPercent . The number after that phrase is your current maximum battery capacity. This number is a percentage, so if your log gives you a 90 after this number, your battery capacity is at 90%. You can search the log by using Find in Note if you're using the Notes app. Find in Note is located under the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. On a computer, you can use the Find function , which is available in most text editors by clicking Ctrl + F on Windows or Cmd + F Mac. 9. Search for CycleCount . The number after that phrase is the current battery cycle count. Every time your iPad battery is charged from 0 to 100, that counts as a cycle. Apple says that iPads should maintain about 80% of total battery capacity after 1000 cycles. 10. Go to https://www.itecheverything.com/powerutil on your iPad. PowerUtil is a shortcut that allows you to read your analytics logs easily, without having to search through the information yourself. Shortcuts are basically macros that allow you to do a number of tasks on your iPad with the tap of one button. Adding PowerUtil to your iPad is safe as there are no new files being downloaded, and data is not shared. This method will work on any model of iPad. However, you will need to first enable Share iPad Analytics in your settings. To learn how, see this method . 11. Click the blue Add to Shortcuts button. Follow the on-screen prompts to add the shortcut to your iPad. 12. Open your Shortcuts app. The Shortcuts app has a blue icon with pink and blue intersecting squares. 13. Tap the PowerUtil shortcut. The shortcut will direct you to the Analytics section in your Settings. 14. Read the pop-up. PowerUtil will give you a pop-up every time you use it letting you know how to use the shortcut. Once you've read it you can dismiss it. 15. Tap Analytics Data . Once again, you must have Share iPad Analytics toggled on so your iPad generates the correct log. 16. Find the most recent Analytics log. The log will be titled Analytics on iOS 16 and newer, and log-aggregated on iOS 15 and older. 17. Click the share button in the upper right corner. 18. Tap the PowerUtil button. If you don't see the PowerUtil button, you can try one of the following: Close and re-open the Share menu. Select and unselect some of the log by pressing and holding your finger on the text. Restart your iPad . 19. Read the results. PowerUtil will show you your maximum battery capacity and cycle count, as well as your iPad's average temperature. 20. Download iMazing for Windows or Mac. iMazing is a desktop app that you can use to manage your iPhone and iPad. It has many features, including monitoring your device's battery health . iMazing will work to check the battery health of any iPad, including iPad Pro and iPad Air. 21. Install iMazing and run the program once it's installed. When you first start the program, it will ask if you have an activation code. Click the arrow at the bottom of the screen to proceed to the free trial mode of iMazing. iMazing has a number of features that are available for free, including battery diagnostics. Buying a license isn't required to check your battery health. 22. Plug your iPad into your computer. You can connect your iPad to your PC or Mac using its original charging cable. 23. Follow the instructions on your iPad screen to trust your computer. If you're on a Mac, you'll have to confirm the Allow prompt on your computer screen as well as the Trust prompt on your iPad. 24. Click the battery icon in the bottom right corner. The initial percentage displayed is your device's current battery charge, which isn't what we're looking for. In the pop-up display look for Battery Effective Max. Charge and Battery Charge Cycles .",

Choose a countdown timer length. Select a microphone if you want to record your voice along with the screen. Show animations that represent mouse clicks (helpful when creating how-to videos). 3. Choose an area of the screen to record. If you want to record the entire screen, just click the square made of several dashed lines with a circle at its bottom-right corner. If you want to record just a single window or portion of the screen, follow these steps: Click the icon that looks like a window with a circle at its bottom-right corner. The screen will dim around a bright rectangular area. The brighter area inside of the rectangle is the area that will be recorded. Move the rectangle to the desired area, and/or click and drag its edges to make it the correct size for your needs. 4. Click Record . It's at the far-right edge of the toolbar. Screen recording begins immediately. 5. Click the Stop button when you're finished. You'll see the black circle with a white square inside on the menu bar at the top-right corner of the screen. You can also press Command + Control + Esc to stop recording. The recorded videos will be saved in the MOV format on desktop. 6. Open QuickTime Player on your Mac. You'll find it in your Applications folder, on the Launchpad, and/or by searching for quicktime in Spotlight search. 7. Click the File menu and select New Screen Recording . Depending on your version of macOS, you'll either see a Screen Recording panel, or the macOS Screenshot toolbar. If you see a gray toolbar with options for taking screenshots and a button that says \"Record\" at the end, use this method to record your screen instead. 8. Choose your recording options. Click the down-arrow next to the red recording button to expand options, including microphone selection (if you want to record your voice while recording the screen) and the option to enable or disable animations that display mouse clicks. 9. Click the \"Record\" button. It's the red button at the bottom of the Screen Recording bar. A selection box will appear. 10. Choose an area of the screen to record. You have two options: To record the entire screen, click anywhere on the screen to start recording. To record a specific area, click and drag the area you want to record, and then click Start Recording . 11. Click the Stop button when you're finished. You'll see the black circle with a white square inside on the menu bar at the top-right corner of the screen. You can also press Command + Control + Esc to stop recording.

Here's how:\n\n**Step 1: Open the Screenshot Toolbar**\n\nPress **Shift + Command + 5** on your keyboard. This will bring up the Screenshot toolbar at the bottom of your screen.\n\n\n\n**Step 2: Choose Your Recording Option**\n\nOn the toolbar, you'll see several options.\n*   To record your **entire screen**, click the icon that looks like a solid rectangle with a circle in the corner (it says \"Record Entire Screen\" when you hover over it).\n*   To record a **selected portion** of your screen, click the icon that looks like a dotted rectangle with a circle in the corner (it says \"Record Selected Portion\").\n\n\n\n**Step 3: Start Recording**\n\n*   If you chose to record the entire screen, your pointer will change to a camera icon. Click anywhere on the screen to start recording.\n*   If you chose to record a selected portion, drag to select the area you want to record, then click the \"Record\" button within that selected area.\n\n\n\n**Step 4: Stop Recording**\n\nTo stop the recording, click the Stop button in the menu bar at the top of your screen. It looks like a square inside a circle. Alternatively, you can press **Command + Control + Esc**.\n\n**Step 5: Access Your Recording**\n\nOnce you stop recording, a thumbnail of the video will briefly appear in the bottom-right corner of your screen. You can click on it to open the video in QuickTime Player, where you can trim, save, or share it. By default, recordings are saved to your Desktop.",

If you don't have it, you can download it from your device's app store.\n    .\n\n2.  **Select Your Languages:**\n    Tap on the language buttons at the top to select the source language (the language of the text you're scanning) and the target language (the language you want it translated into). For example, if you're scanning a French menu and want it in English, select French as the source and English as the target.\n    .\n\n3.  **Tap the Camera Icon:**\n    Once your languages are set, tap on the camera icon at the bottom of the screen. This will open the camera view within the app.\n    .\n\n4.  **Position Your Phone Over the Text:**\n    Point your phone's camera at the text you want to translate. Google Translate will attempt to instantly translate the text on your screen. Try to hold your phone steady and ensure good lighting for the best results.\n    .\n\n5.  **Scan for a More Detailed Translation (Optional):**\n    For a more precise translation, or if the instant translation isn't clear, you can tap the \"Scan\" button at the bottom. This will take a picture of the text.\n    .\n\n6.  **Highlight Text to Translate:**\n    After scanning, you can use your finger to highlight specific words or sections of text that you want to translate. The translation will appear at the top of the screen.\n    .\n\nAnd there you have it! You can now effectively use Google Translate to scan and translate text on the go.",

    "text_ref": "1. Go to https://account.live.com/password/reset . Since you can't log into your computer, you can go to that website in your smartphone or tablet's web browser. Use this method if you sign into a Microsoft account when you sign into your computer. In this case, you'll change your Microsoft password so you can use your new password to log in. You can also click Forgot my PIN or I forgot my password on the login screen. 2. Enter the account name you would like to recover. You can enter an email address (it doesn't have to be an Outlook address and can be any email address that you used to create the Microsoft account), a phone number, or a Skype name. Click Next to continue. 3. Choose how to verify your account. Depending on the backup methods you listed, you can get an email or text to verify that you're the owner of the account. Click or tap a method to select it, then click or tap Get code . 4. Enter the code into the verification field. If the verification method is valid, you'll get a text or email with a 6-digit code. If you didn't get the code, select Use a different verification option . Select Next to continue. 5. Reset your password. Passwords need to contain at least 8 characters and are case-sensitive. For example, \"John01\" as a password is not the same as \"john01\". Re-enter the password to confirm it. If the passwords don't match, you'll see an error message. Click Next to continue. 6. Sign in. Once you see a \"Security info updated\" window, the password change has been successful and you'll be able to use that password to sign into your Windows 10 computer. 7. Try to sign-in to the account once. After you fail to produce the correct password immediately, you'll see more options to help you log in. Use this method if you don't sign into a Microsoft account whenever you sign into your computer. 8. Click Reset Password . You may need to click Ok first to see this option. 9. Answer the security questions. When you created the local account, you were required to set security questions and answers. If you get one wrong, you won't know which one, but will need to answer all 3 again. If you have a disk to reset your password, select Use a password disk instead and follow the on-screen instructions. 10. Reset your password. Once you've answered the security questions correctly, you can reset the password to log into your Windows 10 computer.

If neither of these is an option and you don't have a Microsoft account, you might need to reinstall Windows.\n\n**Method 1: Using a Password Reset Disk (if you created one previously)**\n\n1.  **Insert the Password Reset Disk:** Plug your USB drive (the one you used to create the password reset disk) into your computer.\n2.  **Attempt to Log In:** At the Windows 10 login screen, type an incorrect password. Windows will display a message indicating the password is wrong.\n3.  **Click \"Reset password\":** After entering an incorrect password, a \"Reset password\" link will appear below the password field. Click it.\n\n    4.  **Follow the Password Reset Wizard:** The Password Reset Wizard will launch. Click \"Next\" to continue.\n\n    5.  **Select your Password Reset Disk:** Choose the correct drive from the dropdown menu where your password reset disk is located, then click \"Next.\"\n\n    6.  **Enter a New Password:** Type your new password and confirm it in the respective fields. You can also enter a password hint if you wish. Click \"Next.\"\n\n    7.  **Finish the Wizard:** Click \"Finish\" to complete the password reset process. You can now log in with your new password.\n\n    **Method 2: Using another Administrator Account**\n\nIf you have another account on the computer that has administrator privileges, you can use it to reset your forgotten password.\n\n1.  **Log in with an Administrator Account:** Log into Windows 10 using an account that has administrator rights.\n2.  **Open Computer Management:**\n    *   Right-click the \"Start\" button and select \"Computer Management.\"\n    *   Alternatively, press `Win + X` and select \"Computer Management.\"\n\n    3.  **Navigate to Local Users and Groups:** In the Computer Management window, expand \"Local Users and Groups\" and then click on \"Users.\"\n\n    4.  **Reset the Password:**\n    *   Find the account whose password you forgot, right-click on it, and select \"Set Password...\"\n\n    5.  **Proceed and Enter New Password:** Click \"Proceed\" on the warning message. Then, enter a new password for the account and confirm it. Click \"OK.\"\n\n    ",

    "text_ref": "1. Turn on your Bluetooth speaker and make it discoverable. The steps to make your speaker discoverable vary by model and maker. There's usually a button you press and hold or a switch that you toggle to pair your speaker; if so, it'll be labeled with a Bluetooth icon. It might be a separate button, or it might be a multi-purpose button (i.e., the \"Power\" button can double as the pairing button if it's held down). Depending on the speaker, you may need to plug it in to pair it. Make sure the speaker is close to your Windows 10 computer. 2. Open Action Center. Click the speech bubble icon on the taskbar. You'll usually see this near the right of your screen, as long as the taskbar is still in its default position. Otherwise, you'll find the Action Center icon near the time and date in your taskbar. If you have active notifications, the icon may look more like a square with a small number over it. 3. Click the Bluetooth icon . The tile will turn blue to indicate Bluetooth is on. You can also enable Bluetooth Settings. Go to Settings > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices and slide the \"Bluetooth\" switch to the On position. 4. Click Connect . This is the tile with an icon of two devices. The panel will slide away for a moment as it searches. 5. Click your speaker’s name and icon. If your Bluetooth speaker is in pairing mode, it should show up in the panel on the right of your screen. This connects the speaker to Windows 10. You should now be able to play music and audio from your computer through your speaker. Your PC and speaker will connect whenever they are in range of each other and have Bluetooth turned on.

You'll see this first option at the top of the window next to + . When prompted to select a device that you're pairing, click to choose Bluetooth and all the Bluetooth devices within range will appear here. 5. Put your AirPods into Pairing Mode. You can do this by opening the AirPods case, then pressing and holding the button on the back of it. When the LED flashes white, release the button. This light is either on the front or inside your case. 6. Click to select your AirPods. You should see this device under your list of discovered devices. Pairing between your AirPods and Dell will begin as soon as you select them from the list. 7. Click Done . After your AirPods and laptop pair, you can click Done to close this window.

These hotkeys are represented by two different images of a sun, one for increasing and another for decreasing brightness. Find the keys on your keyboard to get started. These hotkeys will look slightly different on every computer. They are often differentiated by a filled-in sun (decrease) and an empty sun (increase) or a sun with dots for rays (decrease) and a sun with lines for rays (increase). Also be on the lookout for arrows pointing upwards or downwards, indicating an increase or decrease in brightness. These hotkeys will be mapped onto different buttons on different keyboards. Check out your left and right arrow keys, or the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) lining the top of your keyboard. 2. Hold down the \"Fn\" key on your keyboard. The brightness hotkeys are not the primary function of the keys they are mapped onto. You'll therefore needed to hold down the Fn key while you adjust your screen's brightness. 3. Tap the appropriate hotkeys. While holding Fn , tap the corresponding hotkeys to turn your PC's brightness up or down.",

These are usually represented by a sun icon. One icon will have a smaller sun or an arrow pointing down (for decreasing brightness), and the other will have a larger sun or an arrow pointing up (for increasing brightness). They are often found on the F-keys (F1-F12).\n**Step 2:** Depending on your keyboard, you might need to press and hold the \"Fn\" key (usually located near the bottom left of your keyboard, next to the Ctrl key) while simultaneously pressing the brightness function key. For some keyboards, these keys work directly without pressing \"Fn.\"\n**Method 2: Using the Action Center (if keyboard shortcuts are not working)**\n\nIf your function keys aren't adjusting the brightness, or if your keyboard doesn't have dedicated brightness keys, you can still use a keyboard shortcut to access the Action Center and adjust it from there.\n\n**Step 1:** Press the **Windows key + A** simultaneously to open the Action Center.\n**Step 2:** In the Action Center, you'll see a brightness slider or a tile that says \"Brightness.\" Click on this tile multiple times to cycle through brightness levels (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) or use the slider if it's visible.\n",

Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Press the Windows Key + I**: This will open the Settings app on your Windows 10 computer. The Windows key is the key with the Windows logo on it, usually located at the bottom left of your keyboard.\n\n2. **Click on \"Ease of Access\"**: In the Settings app, navigate to the \"Ease of Access\" section. This can be found under the \"System\" category.\n\n3. **Click on \"Display\"**: In the \"Ease of Access\" section, click on \"Display\". This will open the display settings.\n\n4. **Adjust the Brightness**: In the \"Display\" settings, you will see a slider for brightness. You can adjust the brightness by moving the slider left or right. The slider is located on the right side of the screen.\n\n5. **Press the Brightness Key**: If you have a brightness key on your keyboard, you can press it to adjust the brightness. The brightness key is usually located on the right side of the keyboard, near the function keys.\n\n6. **Use the Function Key**: If you do not have a brightness key, you can use the function key (F1-F12) to adjust the brightness. Press the function key and then press the number key that corresponds to the brightness level you want to set. For example, if you want to set the brightness to 50%, press F1 and then 5.\n\n7. **Save the Changes**: Once you have adjusted the brightness to your liking, click on \"Save\" to save the changes.\n\n8. **Close the Settings App**: After saving the changes, close the Settings app.\n\nThat's it!

This is typically represented by a phone receiver icon.\n\n\n**Step 2: Go to Recents/Call History**\nWithin the Phone app, navigate to the \"Recents\" or \"Call History\" tab. This will show you a list of your incoming, outgoing, and missed calls.\n\n\n**Step 3: Select the Number to Block**\nFind the phone number you wish to block from the list. Tap on the number or the contact entry to reveal more options.\n\n\n**Step 4: Tap the Info Icon**\nLook for an \"i\" icon (for information) or a similar icon next to the number. Tapping this will usually take you to details about that particular call or contact.\n\n\n**Step 5: Tap the Three Dots Menu**\nOn the call details screen, you'll often see a three-dot menu icon (also known as a \"kebab\" menu) in the top right corner. Tap this to open a dropdown menu of options.\n\n\n**Step 6: Select \"Block Number\"**\nFrom the dropdown menu, select the \"Block Number\" option. You may be asked to confirm your decision. Once confirmed, the number will be added to your blocked list, and you will no longer receive calls or messages from it.\n",

This will bring up a menu with options.\n\n4. **Tap on \"Block Number\"**: In the menu that appears, select \"Block Number\". This will block the number from calling you.\n\n5. **Confirm the Block**: A confirmation message will appear asking if you want to block the number. Tap \"OK\" to confirm.\n\n6. **Check the Blocked Numbers**: To check if the number is blocked, go to the Phone app and tap on the three vertical dots in the top right corner. Tap on \"Blocked numbers\" to see the list of blocked numbers.\n\nHere is a text-based version of the steps:\n\n1. Open the Phone app.\n2. Find the number to block.\n3. Long press on the number.\n4.

If you were sent a screenshot through Messages or another messaging service, be sure to save it to your gallery. As this is a recent feature, make sure to update your iOS version . 2. Open the screenshot. Locate the screenshot in your gallery and tap it. 3. Long-press the QR code. To long-press, tap and hold the code. A pop-up menu will open. You'll see several options, depending on the link. 4. Tap Open in Safari . If you have another preferred browser, you can select it. Additionally, if the link leads to a website that has a mobile app installed on your device, you can tap Open in (app) . You'll be redirected to the link immediately. 5. Enable scanning on your device if needed. In iOS 12 later, QR code scanning is enabled automatically. If you are using iOS 11, or your camera app is not scanning QR codes automatically, you may need to enable QR code scanning in the Settings menu. Use the following steps to enable QR code scanning: Open the Settings app. Scroll down and tap Camera . Toggle on Scan QR codes . If the toggle switch is green, QR code scanning is enabled. 6. Open the Camera app. Tap the Camera app icon on your home screen to open the Camera app. It has an icon that resembles a camera. You can also open the Control Center and tap the camera icon. 7. Select the forward-facing camera. The forward-facing camera is the one on the back of your device. If the camera app is using the back-facing camera (the selfie camera), tap the icon that resembles a camera with two arching arrows in the center to switch to the forward-facing camera. 8. Point the camera at the QR code. The camera will scan the QR code automatically. You'll see the link pop up above the code. 9. Tap the link. You'll be redirected to the link immediately. 10. Add the Code Scanner to the Control Center . If you are not able to access the QR Code Reader in the Control Center, you may need to add it in the Settings app. Use the following steps to add the QR Code Reader to the Control Center. Open the Settings app. Scroll down and tap Control Center . Tap Customize Controls . Tap the green plus (+) icon next to Code Scanner . If it is listed under \"Included controls\", it's already in the Control Center. 11. Open the Control Center. Swipe down from the top-right corner to open it. On some iPhone models, you need to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the Control Center. 12. Tap the icon that resembles a QR code. This opens the Code Scanner. 13. Aim the camera at a QR code. Aim the camera so that the QR code is centered within the four white brackets in the center of the screen. The Code Scanner will scan the QR Code and open the link contained within the QR code automatically. If needed, tap the flashlight icon to provide a light as you scan. 14. Tap Always Allow . You'll see a pop-up of the QR code link, and you must allow permission to open it. Your QR code will open. 15. Open the Snapchat app. It’s a yellow icon with an image that resembles a white ghost. Tap the icon to open Snapchat. You can use a Snapcode to quickly add friends on Snapchat . 16. Hold your phone over a Snapcode or any QR code. You should see the QR code in the center of the screen. If you are using the back-facing (selfie) camera instead of the forward-facing camera, tap the icon with two arrows drawing the shape of a smartphone in the upper-right corner to switch cameras. 17. Tap and hold the QR code on the screen. Once the code scans, a pop-up will appear in the center of the screen. You can use the Snapchat scanner to scan regular QR codes or Snapcodes. 18. Tap the purple button in the center. This will open the URL in the QR code or Snapcode. This is a good way to add friends in Snapchat. Tap ADD FRIEND at the bottom of the popup to do so. You can let friends scan your Snapcode, as well. Swipe down on your camera screen in Snapchat and you will see you Snapcode.",

It usually looks like a gray square with a camera lens.\n\n\n**Step 2: Point Your Camera at the QR Code**\n\nHold your iPhone steady and position the camera so that the QR code is clearly visible within the viewfinder. You don't need to press any buttons; the camera will automatically detect the QR code.\n\n\n**Step 3: Tap the Notification**\n\nOnce your iPhone recognizes the QR code, a notification will appear at the top of your screen.

Open the Zoom app and log in, then start or join a meeting . 2. Click or tap the microphone icon. You'll see this in the bottom left corner of your screen. If you don't see it, click or tap the screen to bring up the icon row. When the icon is red and has a line through it, your microphone is muted. 3. Click or tap the microphone icon again. If the previous action muted your microphone, this action unmutes it. You can also mute yourself automatically or enable Push-to-talk to temporarily unmute yourself in the Settings menu. 4. Open your Zoom Settings menu. If you want your microphone to be muted when you join meetings, you can do that by making a quick change in your settings. To get there, click or tap your profile icon to open the menu, then select Settings . On a computer, the profile icon is in the upper-right corner of Zoom. On an Android, iPhone, or iPad, it’s in the upper-left corner of the mobile app. Alternatively, on a PC or Mac, you can click the small gear icon in the upper-right corner of Zoom. 5. Click Meetings & webinars (desktop) or Meetings (mobile). This opens the settings menu for your meetings. 6. Select the option to mute your microphone. If you're using a computer, click the toggle switch next to “Keep my microphone muted.” On mobile, tap the toggle switch next to “Mute my microphone.”",

Click on the button with three horizontal bars on the upper right corner of the browser. This will bring down the main menu. 3. Trigger the auto-update. Click “About Google Chrome” from the menu. The About page will load. This will also trigger Google Chrome to check for updates. You will notice a “Checking for updates” status under the version number of the browser. If an update is found, Google Chrome will apply the update. 4. Exit Google Chrome. In order to properly apply the update, you have to exit and restart it. Google Chrome will save all your opened tabs and windows. 5. Restart Google Chrome. Open the browser again. It will automatically open the previous opened tabs and windows so you can continue from where you left off. If you wish to set Chrome to do this automatically when it starts up, open the menu like described above, but click \"Settings\" from the menu instead of \"About Google Chrome\". After the page loads, find the \"On startup\" section (you may need to scroll up/down the page to find it). Once it is found, make sure you have selected the \"Open a specific page or set of pages\" option. Click the \"Add a new page\" button and it will ask for a URL. Use the address for the \"About Google Chrome\" page as the URL (chrome://settings/help) and then click the \"Add\" button. Doing this will set Chrome to automatically check for updates on when launched.",

    "text_ref": "1. Open the Recycle Bin on your PC. Before you panic or try another method, double-check your Recycle Bin to make sure the file isn't still in there. You'll usually see the Recycle Bin icon on your desktop, but if you don't, you can also fine it by pressing the Windows key, typing recycle , and clicking Recycle Bin . [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source 2. Browse or search for a file. If your Recycle Bin has a lot of files, it may be helpful to use the search bar at the top-right corner. You can also simply scroll through the files to look for the one you need. 3. Right-click a file and choose Restore . This will return the deleted file to the folder from which you deleted it. To restore multiple files at once, hold down the Control key as you click each file, then right-click anywhere in the highlighted area and choose Restore . You can also restore all deleted files from the Recycle Bin at once by clicking Restore all items at the top of the window. 4. Know when to use this method. If you aren't able to restore a file from the Recycle Bin or find it in your backup, this method can help you regain access to lost files. [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source You have to restore the missing files to a drive that is not the same drive the file was deleted from—this means that if you only have one hard drive, you'll need to connect a USB flash or other external drive to your PC to restore the lost files. If you don't have another drive to use, you won't be able to use this method. It's not possible to restore files to or from a cloud storage or networked drive with this method. 5. Install Windows File Recovery by Microsoft. This utility might already be installed on some systems, but not all. Open the Microsoft Store app from the Windows Start menu. Search for Windows File Recovery . If you see the option to do so, click Get and follow the on-screen instructions to install. If the app is already installed, you'll see Open instead. 6. Open Windows File Recovery. It's easy—just type windows file recovery into the Windows Search field (press Windows key + S if you don't see it), and then click Windows File Recovery in the search results. This will open a command prompt window. If prompted, give the app permission to make changes to your computer. 7. Determine the mode you want to use. There are two different modes for restoring files: Regular mode: Use this mode if the file you deleted was from a drive formatted with NTFS and the drive is not corrupted. Extensive mode: Use this mode if the file you deleted was on a drive formatted as FAT or exFAT, which is common for flash cards and other removable media, or the drive is corrupted. This mode will take a little longer. If you're not sure which mode to use, start with Regular mode, and then try Extensive if that doesn't work. 8. Use the winfr command to restore your files. The command will look like this winfr source-drive: destination-drive: /mode /switches file-or-folder . The /n switch lets you specify files and folders to recover. Here are some examples you can use in both regular and extensive modes: [4] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source If you want to recover all files ending with .JPEG from your pictures directory on the C drive to a recovery folder on your F drive, you'd use winfr C: F: /regular /n *\\Users\\yourusername\\Pictures\\*.JPEG . You can also use /n multiple times to recover files that meet multiple criteria. For example, to recover both JPEG and PNG files from your Pictures folder, you could use winfr C: F: /regular /n \\Users\\yourusername\\Pictures\\*.JPEG /n \\Users\\yourusername\\Pictures\\*.PNG . To recover all files ending with .docx from any location on the original drive, you could use winfr C: F: /regular /n *.docx . To recover your entire Documents folder from the C: drive to the F: drive, you'd use winfr C: F: /regular \\Users\\yourusername\\Documents\\ . Note the trailing backslash \\ at the end of the folder name—this is necessary when recovering an entire folder. 9. Press Y to confirm. Windows File Recovery will now attempt to recover the file(s). If the recovery is successful, the files will be saved to the destination drive in a new folder called \"Recovery_(date and time).\" [5] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source If you're unable to recover the files in regular mode, run the same command again replacing /regular with /extensive . Some file types are hidden from results by default, including .log, .vbs, .c, .cab, .py, and .lnk. If you are unable to find the type of file you're looking for, run the recovery again, this time adding the /e switch to disable extended filtering.",

    "Gemini_text": "Recovering permanently deleted files in Windows 10 can be challenging, but it's often possible using a few different methods. Here's a guide with illustrated steps:\n\n**Method 1: Using Previous Versions (File History/Restore Points)**\n\nThis method works if you have File History enabled or system restore points created.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Parent Folder**\nNavigate to the folder where the file was originally located. Right-click on this folder and select \"Properties.\"\n**Step 2: Access Previous Versions**\nIn the Properties window, click on the \"Previous Versions\" tab. You'll see a list of available previous versions of that folder, based on your File History or restore points.\n**Step 3: Restore the Folder**\nSelect a version that you know contains the deleted file (ideally, a date before you deleted it) and click \"Restore.\" This will restore the entire folder to that previous state.\n**Method 2: Using Windows File Recovery Tool**\n\nMicrosoft offers a free command-line utility called Windows File Recovery. It's more advanced and requires some command-line knowledge.\n\n**Step 1: Install Windows File Recovery**\nOpen the Microsoft Store, search for \"Windows File Recovery,\" and install it.\n**Step 2: Determine Your Drive Mode**\nBefore running the tool, you need to determine the file system of the drive where the files were lost (NTFS, FAT, exFAT, or ReFS). Right-click the drive in File Explorer, select \"Properties,\" and look under the \"General\" tab. This will help you choose the correct recovery mode.\n**Step 3: Run Windows File Recovery from Command Prompt**\nOpen Command Prompt as an administrator. The basic command structure is:\n\n`winfr source-drive: destination-drive: /mode /switches`\n\n*   **source-drive:** The drive where the files were deleted (e.g., C:).\n*   **destination-drive:** A different drive where you want to save the recovered files (you cannot recover to the same drive).\n*   **/mode:** Choose `/regular`, `/extensive`, `/segment`, or `/signature` depending on your file system and deletion scenario. `/extensive` is often a good starting point for permanently deleted files.\n*   **/switches:** Filters to target specific files (e.g., `/n *.docx` for Word documents, `/n \"Folder Name\\\"` for a specific folder).\n\nExample: To recover all `.jpg` files from drive C: to drive D: using extensive mode:\n`winfr C: D: /extensive /n *.jpg`\n**Method 3: Using Third-Party Data Recovery Software**\n\nMany third-party tools are available that offer a more user-friendly graphical interface for file recovery. These often have free versions that can scan and preview files, but require a paid license for actual recovery.\n\n**Step 1: Choose and Install Software**\nResearch reputable data recovery software like Recuva, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, or Disk Drill. Download and install it on a drive *different* from where you want to recover files to avoid overwriting the deleted data.\n**Step 2: Scan the Drive**\nLaunch the software and select the drive where your files were permanently deleted. Start the scan. This can take some time depending on the size of the drive.\n**Step 3: Preview and Recover Files**\nAfter the scan, the software will display a list of recoverable files. You can often filter by file type or search for specific file names. Preview the files to ensure they are the ones you want. Select the desired files and click \"Recover,\" choosing a *different* destination drive to save them.\nImportant Tips for File Recovery:**\n\n*   **Stop Using the Drive Immediately:** The moment you realize files are deleted, stop using the drive. Continued use can write new data over the \"deleted\" files, making them unrecoverable.\n*   **Recover to a Different Drive:** Always recover files to a different drive than the one they were deleted from.\n*   **Act Quickly:** The sooner you try to recover, the higher the chances of success.\n*   **Regular Backups:** The best prevention is to regularly back up your important files using File History, cloud storage, or external drives.",

Here are the steps to recover permanently deleted files in Windows 10:\n\n1. **Stop Using the Drive:**\n   - Immediately stop using the drive where the files were deleted. This is crucial because once new data is written to the drive, the deleted files become harder to recover.\n\n2. **Download and Install a Data Recovery Software:**\n   - Download a data recovery software from a reputable source. Some popular options include EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, Recuva, and MiniTool Power Data Recovery.\n\n3. **Run the Data Recovery Software:**\n   - Install the software and launch it. The software will scan the drive for deleted files.\n\n4. **Select the Drive:**\n   - Choose the drive where the files were deleted. The software will scan the drive for deleted files.\n\n5. **Select the File Type:**\n   - Choose the type of files you want to recover. This can be done by selecting the file type or by using the \"Select All\" option.\n\n6. **Start the Scan:**\n   - Click the \"Scan\" button to start the scan. The software will scan the drive for deleted files.\n\n7. **Preview and Recover Files:**\n   - Once the scan is complete, the software will display a list of deleted files. You can preview the files to make sure they are the ones you want to recover.\n   - Select the files you want to recover and click the \"Recover\" button.\n\n8. **Choose a Location to Save the Recovered Files:**\n   - Choose a location to save the recovered files. It's important to save them on a different drive than the one they were deleted from to avoid overwriting the deleted files.\n\n9. **Wait for the Recovery Process:**\n   - The software will start the recovery process. This may take some time depending on the size of the files and the speed of your computer.\n\n10. **Verify the Recovered Files:**\n    - Once the recovery process is complete, verify that the recovered files are correct and in good condition.\n\n11. **Back Up Your Data:**\n    - It's always a good idea to back up your data regularly to prevent data loss in the future.\n\nRemember, the success of the recovery process depends on the speed at which you stop using the drive and the quality of the data recovery software you use.",

    "text_ref": "1. Do Not Disturb mode does not affect your alarm. Whether you set your alarm in the Clock app , using Siri, or by creating a Sleep Focus, you can rest assured that your iPhone's alarm will go off when your phone is on Do Not Disturb. To make sure your iPhone's alarm goes off when you need it, see Setting Your Alarm Properly . If your iPhone's alarm didn't go off while on Do Not Disturb, see Why didn't my alarm go off? Your iPhone alarm will also go off in Silent mode. If you've switched the physical Silent Mode switch to On, your alarm will still go off as scheduled. 2. Open the Clock app on your iPhone. There are two easy ways to get to the Clock app: You can either tap the Clock app on your Home screen or in your App Library, or open the Control Center and tap the Clock icon. 3. Tap the + . You'll see it at the top-right corner of the app. If you want to edit an existing alarm, tap Edit at the top-left corner, then choose an alarm. 4. Select the time you want your alarm to sound. Scroll up or down on each of the three wheels to choose the exact hour, minute, and time of day (AM or PM) you want your alarm to sound. Don't forget to choose AM to ensure your alarm goes off in the morning, or PM for a night alarm. 5. Choose whether to repeat the alarm. By default, your iPhone's alarm will only go off once. If you want to set an alarm that repeats daily, weekly, or on certain days, you can create a repeating alarm: Tap Repeat . Choose which days you'd like this alarm to go off at the selected time. Tapping a day adds a checkmark to that day. For example, if you want your alarm to ring at the same time every weekday, select Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday . If you only want to use this alarm once, don't select any days. Tap Back to return to the previous screen when you're finished. 6. Add a label for this alarm (optional). If you're setting a recurring alarm, you can add a name to the alarm so you'll always know which alarm you're using. To do so: Tap Label . Type a name for the alarm, such as Work or School . Tap the done key on the keyboard to save. 7. Select an alarm sound. By default, your alarm sound is Radar , but you can choose any alarm sound on your iPhone. To change the sound: Tap Sound . Tap a sound to hear a preview. The orange checkmark will move next to the selected sound. Tap Back once you've settled on your preferred sound. 8. Toggle Snooze on or off. If you want to give yourself a chance to sleep for 10 extra minutes by tapping Snooze when your alarm sounds, leave the Snooze switch in the On (green) position. If not, you can tap the switch to turn it off. If you turn off Snooze for this alarm, you won't be given the option to snooze your alarm when it goes off. This means that if you turn your alarm off in your sleep, it won't ring again. Disable this option at your own risk! 9. Tap Save . It's at the top-right corner of the screen. Your alarm is now properly set and will go off at the selected time, on the selected days, even in Do Not Disturb.",

Click on an app in Finder just once to select but not open the app. Double-clicking on the app you wish to remove will open the app. If you accidentally open an app, you do not need to close it to delete the app. Navigate back to Finder and be sure the app is still selected. You can tell an app is selected if its name is highlighted in Finder. 3. Once an app has been selected, delete it by selecting File > Move to trash . In the top right corner of your Mac screen, find the File tab. Click File and locate the option to Move to trash near the bottom of the pop-up menu. By choosing Move to trash, the selected app will be deleted from Finder and moved to your Mac trash. You can also delete an app by hold-clicking on it in Finder, and then dragging it with your mouse to the trashcan icon in the dock. Deleted apps still in the Trash will continue to take up storage space on your Mac. Empty your trash by clicking the trashcan icon on the app dock and selecting the Empty option in the top right corner of the window. 4. Recover an app by opening the Trash and dragging it back into Applications . If you accidentally deleted the wrong app, open the Trash by clicking on the trashcan icon located in your dock. Find the app you want to recover and hold-click on the app while dragging it with your mouse back into the Applications tab to the left of the files in the trash.",

It's in the bottom-right side of the screen and has a magnifying class icon above it. 3. Tap the search bar. This option is at the top of the screen. 4. Search for a phone call-recording app. You'll probably have to spend some money to download a call-recording app. A few of the best-rated apps include the following: TapeACall Pro - You'll pay $9.99 up-front but, unlike most other call recorders, you won't have to pay per-minute. Call Recorder - IntCall - This app is free up-front, while the per-minute recording cost is around $0.10. You'll need to be connected to Wi-Fi to use this service. Call Recording by NoNotes - Free to download and you get 20 minutes of free calls per month. After the free minutes expire, services cost around $0.25 per minute. 5. Tap Get to the right of your selected app. If you're purchasing an app, this button will be replaced by the app's cost instead. 6. Tap Install . It will be in the same location as the Get button. 7. Enter your Apple ID password. Doing so will prompt your app to begin downloading. If you've recently logged into the App Store, you won't have to perform this step. If your iPhone uses Touch ID, you may be able to use your fingerprint here instead. 8. Launch your app and make a call. While the particulars will vary from app to app, they all work in essentially the same way. You'll be connected to their servers and then the call will be merged with the line you are calling. If prompted, you may need to accept the Terms and Conditions and enter your phone number. When the call is merged, the recording begins. When the call ends or you've gone over the allotted or available recording time, the recording is terminated automatically. 9. Play back your call. The calls are stored either in the cloud or on your provider's servers and will be displayed in a list. For Call Recorder - IntCall, tap \"Recording\" at the bottom of the screen to bring up a list of your recordings, then tap the \"Play\" button to play back a specific recording. Some services even provide online storage, management, and retrieval. You can often edit your calls, trimming to only the parts of the call you want to save. From there, you can email or manage the recordings as you would any other computer file.",

The app will usually prompt you to start recording when you answer the call.\n\n6. **Stop Recording:**\n   - When you want to stop recording, open the recording app and stop the recording. The app will save the recording to your device.\n\n7. **Review and Save the Recording:**\n   - The recording app will usually provide options to review and save the recording. Review the recording to ensure it is complete and clear, then save it to your device.\n\n8. **Share the Recording:**\n   - If you want to share the recording with others, the app may provide options to share it via email, messaging apps, or other platforms.\n\nRemember, recording phone calls without the consent of the other party is illegal in many countries.

This can significantly speed up your browsing and selection process. Here's how to enable it:\n\n**Step 1: Open File Explorer**\n\nNavigate to File Explorer. You can do this by clicking the folder icon on your taskbar, or by pressing the `Windows key + E`.\n\n**Step 2: Access the 'View' Tab**\n\nOnce in File Explorer, locate and click on the 'View' tab at the top of the window.\n\n**Step 3: Select 'Options'**\n\nWithin the 'View' tab, look for the 'Options' button on the far right. Click on it to open Folder Options.\n\n**Step 4: Navigate to the 'View' Tab in Folder Options**\n\nIn the 'Folder Options' window, click on the 'View' tab.\n\n**Step 5: Uncheck 'Always show icons, never thumbnails'**\n\nScroll down the 'Advanced settings' list until you find the option 'Always show icons, never thumbnails'. Make sure this box is **unchecked**. If it's checked, Windows will only display generic icons for your image files instead of their previews.\n\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone . It has an icon that resembles two silver gears. You can prevent photos from being deleted from your iCloud by disabling iCloud Photos sync in Settings. Warning: There is a drawback to this method. While you can delete photos from your iPhone without deleting them from iCloud, reenabling iCloud photo syncing in the future will resync your photos and remove all of the deleted ones from iCloud. Only use this method if you won't be using iCloud photo syncing again. 2. Tap your Name/Apple ID. It's at the top of the Settings menu next to your profile icon. 3. Tap iCloud . It's next to an icon that resembles a blue cloud. 4. Tap Photos . It's next to an icon that resembles a colorful pinwheel. 5. Toggle off \"Sync with iCloud.\" It's the first option below the colorful pinwheel icon at the top of the menu. This disables sync between iPhone and iCloud and allows you to delete photos on your iPhone without deleting them on iCloud. If you have \"Optimize iPhone Storage\" enabled, you will be asked if you want to Remove from iPhone or Download Photos & Videos . Either option will allow you to delete your photos from your iPhone without deleting them from your iCloud. 6. Sign out of your Apple ID. If you sign out of your Apple ID on your iPhone, all your data and photos will still be stored on your iCloud account. You can then use a different Apple ID on your iPhone to keep your photos in your original iCloud account. To sign out: Open the Settings app. Tap your Name/Apple ID at the top of the menu. Tap Sign Out . Enter your Apple ID password. Tap the toggle switch next to the items you want to keep. Tap Sign Out again to confirm. 7. Sign in with a different Apple ID. To do so, you will first need to create a new Apple ID . Then, you can use the following steps to sign in: Open the Settings app. Tap Sign in to your iPhone . Sign in with your new Apple ID username and password. If you don't have a new Apple ID, tap Don't have an Apple ID or forgot it and follow the prompts to create a new Apple ID. Choose whether or not you want to merge your iPhone data with iCloud. Enter the verification code. 8. Choose whether or not to merge your iPhone data with iCloud. If you want to merge your iPhone data with your new iCloud account, tap Merge . If you do not, tap Don't Merge . 9. Delete your photos. Use the following steps to delete your photos once you disable iCloud Photos sync: Open the Photos app. Tap the All Photos tab. Tap Select in the upper-right corner. Tap the photos you want to delete. Tap the trashcan icon in the lower-right corner.",

    "Gemini_text": "Unlocking an Android device when you've forgotten your PIN can be a bit tricky, but there are several methods you can try. Here’s a breakdown of common approaches:\n\n### Method 1: Google Account (Android 4.4 and Older)\n\nThis method works if your device is running Android 4.4 KitKat or an older version. Newer Android versions have removed this specific feature for security reasons.\n\n**Step 1: Incorrect PIN Attempts**\nEnter an incorrect PIN several times until you see an option like \"Forgot pattern,\" \"Forgot PIN,\" or \"Forgot password\" appear on the screen.\n\n**Step 2: Enter Google Account Details**\nTap on the \"Forgot PIN\" (or similar) option. You'll then be prompted to enter the Google Account username and password that was previously synced with the device.\n \n\n**Step 3: Reset PIN**\nOnce you've successfully entered your Google Account details, your phone should unlock, and you'll be given the option to set a new PIN.\n\n### Method 2: Find My Device (Google Account)\n\nThis method works for most modern Android devices and requires that \"Find My Device\" (formerly Android Device Manager) was enabled on your phone and it has an active internet connection.\n\n**Step 1: Access Find My Device**\nOn a computer or another mobile device, go to google.com/android/find and sign in with the Google Account that is linked to your locked phone.\n\n**Step 2: Select Your Device**\nIf you have multiple Android devices, select the one you want to unlock from the list.\n\n**Step 3: Choose \"Erase Device\" (Last Resort)**\nYou'll see options like \"Play Sound,\" \"Secure Device,\" and \"Erase Device.\"\n \n\n*   **\"Secure Device\":** In some cases, this option allows you to set a new password or PIN, but this feature can vary by Android version and device manufacturer. It's worth trying first.\n*   **\"Erase Device\":** This is a drastic measure, as it will factory reset your phone, deleting all data (photos, apps, messages, etc.). However, it will also remove the PIN lock. After erasing, you'll need to set up your phone again, including setting a new lock screen.\n\n### Method 3: Factory Reset (Recovery Mode)\n\nIf the above methods don't work, a factory reset via Recovery Mode is usually the final solution, but it will erase all data on your phone.\n\n**Step 1: Power Off Your Phone**\nTurn off your Android device completely.\n\n**Step 2: Enter Recovery Mode**\nThis step varies depending on your phone's manufacturer. Common combinations include:\n*   Volume Down + Power button\n*   Volume Up + Power button\n*   Volume Down + Home + Power button\n*   Volume Up + Home + Power button\n\nPress and hold the correct combination until you see the Android logo or the Recovery Mode menu.\n \n\n**Step 3: Navigate and Select \"Wipe data/factory reset\"**\nUse the Volume buttons to navigate through the menu options and the Power button to select. Find \"Wipe data/factory reset\" and select it. Confirm your choice when prompted.\n\n**Step 4: Reboot System**\nOnce the reset is complete, select \"Reboot system now.\" Your phone will restart, and you'll go through the initial setup process as if it were a new device.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n*   **Backup:** Always back up your Android device regularly to avoid data loss in situations like this.\n*   **Google Account:** Remember your Google Account credentials. They are crucial for unlocking your device or recovering it after a factory reset.\n*   **Manufacturer Specifics:** Some manufacturers (like Samsung, LG) offer their own device management services that can remotely unlock or wipe your device. Check your manufacturer's website for more information.",

    "prompt": "How to Change the IP Address on a Mac? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Install a VPN from the App Store. The easiest way to change your IP address on a Mac is to use a VPN (virtual private network). The VPN will mask your computer’s public IP address by routing your internet traffic through a secure server. To get started, install a VPN on your Mac from the App Store or the VPN provider’s website. Some of the most popular VPNs for Mac include Surfshark, ExpressVPN, and NordVPN. Most of these services are available for a low monthly subscription fee. There are also free VPNs available, but they may not be as fast or secure. 2. Create an account and sign in. Once you launch your new VPN software, you’ll be prompted to set up an account. Follow the on-screen instructions to get your VPN up and running. 3. Choose your preferred server. Once you’ve signed in, you can choose from a list of proxy servers to connect to. After you’ve done this, your computer’s public IP address should change based on the server you selected. And that’s it! Enjoy securely surfing the web with your new IP. You can check your public IP address before and after activating the VPN to make sure it’s working right. 4. Click on the Apple logo . You'll see this in the top left corner of your screen. A menu will drop down. A proxy server works similarly to a VPN, but it’s less secure. 5. Click System Settings . You'll see this under \"About This Mac.\" In pre-Ventura versions of macOS, click System Preferences instead. 6. Click Network . Depending on which version of macOS you have, you’ll see this either in the left sidebar or in the main window. 7. Click on the network you’re using. For example, if you’re using a Wi-Fi connection, click on “Wi-Fi.” 8. Click Details… . You’ll see this button next to the name of the network you’re currently connected to. If you’re using a pre-Ventura version of macOS, click the Advanced button at the bottom of the window instead. 9. Click the Proxies tab. Depending on your version of macOS, you'll see this along either the side or the top of the window with tabs for DNS , WINS , 802.1X , TCP/IP , and Hardware . 10. Toggle on the type of proxy configuration you want. You’ll see a list of options to choose from, including “Auto proxy discovery” (which will allow your Mac to automatically search for available proxy servers), “Automatic proxy configuration” (which you can use if you have access to a proxy auto-configuration file, or PAC), and various types of proxy protocols (including HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS). In pre-Ventura versions of macOS, you will find these options in a drop-down menu under Select a protocol to configure . Select “SOCKS Proxy” if you are unsure about which protocol to choose. The “SOCKS Proxy” protocol is often used to route network packets between clients and servers through a proxy and is effective at boosting general security and hiding the client address of applications. Web Proxy (HTTP) and Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS) are also commonly used but are less protected than a SOCKS Proxy. 11. Enter the IP address and port in the blank spaces. Once you select a protocol, you’ll see spaces to fill in information about the server. Copy and paste or type in the IP address and port information. If the proxy you’re using requires a password, toggle the switch or tick the box next to “Proxy server requires password.” Enter the login information for the server. Some lists of proxy servers may show the IP address and port separately, while others will display the IP address followed by a : , then the port number. There’s a list of SOCKS proxies here: https://spys.one/en/socks-proxy-list/ . You can find many lists of public proxy servers with a simple web search. Use terms like “Free proxy server list.” 12. Click OK . You will now be connected to the proxy server indicated. Depending on your version of macOS, you may need to click OK and then Apply to save your settings.",

    "prompt": "How to Force Shut Down or Restart a Frozen Mac? Show easy visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Close open programs first, if possible. If your Mac is not completely frozen, close any open apps before you force your computer to shut down. If you have open programs when you force your Mac to shut down, you could lose unsaved work . In some cases, force quitting may even corrupt open programs. If you haven't already tried to shut down your Mac normally, you should do that first. Click the Apple menu and select Shut Down to do so. If a program is hung, you can force quit it . If you have any external devices connected to your Mac, such as a flash drive or external SSD, eject them first . 2. Find your Mac's Power button. If you can't shut down your Mac normally, you can turn it off using the power button or key. To find your Mac's power button: ' MacBook without Touch Bar: The Power key is in the top-right corner of the keyboard. MacBook with Touch Bar: The Power button is the Touch ID section on the far-right side of the Touch Bar. It's actually a button that you can press, even though it doesn't look like it. iMac: You'll find the Power button behind the lower-left side of the iMac's screen. Mac Pro: It's on the top of the computer. 3. Press and hold the Power button for at least 10 seconds. Continue holding down the power button or key until the screen goes black. Once the screen is dark, your Mac will turn off. If you see a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to turn off your Mac, you didn't hold down the key for long enough. 4. Wait a minute before turning back on your Mac. This will allow your Mac to fully power down before you attempt to turn it back on. A completely powered-off Mac will have a black screen. On some Mac computers and MacBooks, you won't be able to see the power light nor will you be able to hear any noise from the drives or the fan. 5. Press and Ctrl + ⌥ Opt + ⌘ Cmd + Power . Pressing these keys at the same time will attempt to safely close all open applications on your Mac before shutting it down. If pressing this combination of keys doesn't shut down your Mac, proceed to the next step. 6. Press and hold Ctrl + ⌘ Cmd + Power . This shortcut is similar to the last, except you're not using the Option key this time, and you'll be holding the keys down for a few extra seconds. Press and hold these keys for about 4-5 seconds before releasing them. This key combination will prompt your computer to turn off without safely closing apps and programs first. 7. Start your Mac in Safe Mode . If your MacBook or desktop freezes again after a forced shut down, restart it and press ⇧ Shift as soon as it begins to turn back on, then release the Shift key when you see the Apple logo. Your computer will start in Safe Mode and attempt to repair issues with your disk. Many applications will not work in Safe Mode. Use it for the next couple of steps, then restart it to return your computer to normal. 8. Disable open on startup . Safe Mode prevents programs from opening automatically on startup. To prevent a program from opening after a normal startup, follow these steps: Open the Apple menu . Click Users & Groups . Select your user account in the left pane. Click the Login Items tab. Select the program causing the issue. Click the - button below the list of programs. 9. Uninstall a problematic program. If you have a specific program that you know is causing your Mac to freeze, uninstalling it (and reinstalling it, if you like) will solve the problem: Open Finder. Click the Applications folder (or click the Go menu and click Applications in the resulting drop-down menu). Find the program that keeps freezing. Drag the program into the Trash. 10. Repair your disk. If your computer still has issues that don't seem tied to a specific program, follow these steps to repair your disk: Restart your computer and hold down ⌘ Command + R as it starts up. Click Disk Utility on the startup screen. Click Continue . Select your startup disk and click Repair Disk . Wait for this to complete (it may take a while), then restart your computer. 11. Reset your SMC. The SMC , or System Management Controller, handles many of the physical components on your Mac. An issue with the SMC can prevent your power button from working properly, or cause general slowdowns. If none of the steps above solved your problem, reset the SMC: Laptop with non-removable battery — Shut down your computer and plug it into a power source. Using the left side of the built-in keyboard, hold down ⇧ Shift + Control + ⌥ Option while pressing the \"Power\" button, then release all keys, and finally press the \"Power\" button again. Laptop with removable battery — Shut down your computer. Unplug the power adapter and remove the battery, then hold down the \"Power\" button for five seconds. Release the \"Power\" button, reinsert the battery, and plug in your computer to a power source. Press the \"Power\" button. Desktop — Shut down the iMac and unplug the power cord. Wait fifteen seconds, then plug it back in. Wait five seconds, then press the \"Power\" button.",

Look for the app that's causing the freeze.\n4. Click on the app and then click **Force Quit**.\n5. If the app is still not responding, you can try **Restart** instead.\n\n**Method 2: Restart Your Mac**\n\n1. Press and hold the **Power** button on the top right corner of your Mac.\n2. Hold the button for about 10 seconds until the Mac turns off.\n3. Wait for 10 seconds, then press and hold the **Power** button again to turn it back on.\n\n**Method 3: Use Terminal**\n\n1. Open **Terminal** by going to **Applications** > **Utilities** > **Terminal**.\n2. Type the following command and press **Enter**:\n```\nsudo killall Dock\n```\n3. This will force the **Dock** to restart. If the issue persists, you can try the following command:\n```\nsudo killall SystemUIServer\n```\n4. If the issue is still not resolved, you can try the following command:\n```\nsudo killall Dock\nsudo killall SystemUIServer\n```\n5.

If the switch is gray, tap it to turn it blue now, and then restart Zoom. If you don’t see this option or can’t move the switch, ask your team admin to enable Virtual Backgrounds for you. 2. Open the Zoom desktop application and sign in. The app icon looks like a white icon of a video camera on a light blue background that you'll find in either your Windows menu or Applications folder. 3. Click your profile picture. It's in the upper-right area of Zoom. If you don't have a profile picture, this is the first letter of your name. 4. Click Settings . You'll see this grey gear icon at the top of the list. 5. Click Background & Filters . It's in the left panel. As soon as you click this tab, your camera will activate. 6. Select I have a green screen if you have a physical green screen. Though a green (or any solid color) screen isn’t required, it’ll make your background look a lot more realistic. After you click to check the box, follow the on-screen instructions to click your green screen to set it as the background color. For example, if your green screen is white, anything that is white will be replaced with a virtual background. If you don’t have a green screen but do have a recent Intel i5 or i7 processor and see a Download option under “Enable smart virtual background,” click it to emulate a green screen. This makes it so you can select multiple colors in your background and replace them with a single image. A multi-colored background won't allow Zoom's camera settings to replace a single color with another image, so the result will look pixelated and broken.",

    "text_ref": "1. Use Google Docs to make text-based documents. Like the name suggests, Google Docs is a great place to write out documents just like you would with a Microsoft Word document. You can also use Google Docs to share your documents easily with other people, and you’ll always have access to your Google Docs since they’re stored on the cloud, not on your computer. The best part is that Google Docs is completely free—all you’ll need is a Google account to log in. [2] X Expert Source Anar Kazimov Digital Marketing Expert Expert Interview 2. Pick which template you’d like to use based on your document. Google Docs doesn’t just have blank pages; you can also choose letter templates, resumé templates, project proposals, and a few others. Each template has its own color scheme and layout, so you’ll never get bored no matter what you choose. You can try out a few different templates until you see one that you like. 3. Let Google Docs autosave your document. Another perk of Google Docs is that there is no save button—your computer does it for you! Every time you make a change, your document will save itself to your Google Drive, so you don’t have to worry about losing any data if your computer crashes. You can see the autosave working by looking up in the left hand corner. It will tell you when the document is saving and when it’s been saved to your Drive. 4. Go to https://docs.google.com in a web browser. You can use any Windows or macOS web browser to access Google Docs, including Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. If you don't have a Google/Gmail account, you'll need to create one before you can access Google Docs. 5. Sign in with your Google account. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in with your Google/Gmail account name and password. This brings you to a list of documents you've opened, edited, or otherwise worked on. You'll also see some options for creating a new document at the top of the screen. 6. Click Blank + to create a blank document. It's in the top-left area of the page. This creates a blank document that you can edit however you wish. If you want to create a new document from a template, click Template Gallery near the top-right corner of the page to expand the list, then click a template to create a new document. Popular template options (such as Resume and Brochure ) appear at the top-center area of the page. 7. Click Untitled document to rename the file. The document is called \"Untitled document\" by default. To change the title to something other than \"Untitled document,\" press Del to delete the text, and then type a new name for your document. Press ↵ Enter or ⏎ Return to save your changes. You can also rename your document in the file list on Google Docs. Click the 3 dots in a vertical line on the bottom right of the file, then click “Rename.” You’ve now created your document! From here, you can edit, share, and close your document. 8. Edit your document. As long as you're connected to the internet, Google Docs will save your work as you type. Use the toolbar at the top of the document to adjust the font size, face, color, and style. To adjust the line spacing, click the Format menu, select Line Spacing , and then choose Single , Double , or your preferred option. The Format menu also contains tools for adding columns, headers, footers, headers, and more. To insert an image, table, chart, or special characters, click the Insert menu, choose the item you want to insert, and then follow the on-screen instructions. To change your document to landscape view, open up “File” then click “Page setup.” From there, you can choose “Landscape” or “Portrait.” Google Docs will underline any potential spelling errors—click an underlined word to see suggestions, then click the one you want to use. To spellcheck your entire document, click the Tools menu, and then select Spelling. If you want to download a copy of your document, click the File menu, select Download as , and then choose a format. 9. Share your document. If you want the document to be a collaborative effort with others, you can share it with an individual or group. Here's how: Click the blue Share button near the top-right corner of the page. Enter the email addresses of the people you want to share with, separated by commas. Click the pencil icon to the right of the \"People\" box to view a list of permissions ( Can view , Can edit , Can comment ), then choose an option. Click Advanced at the bottom-right corner of the Sharing window to see more options, and make changes as needed. Click Send to send a link to the document. 10. Exit the document when you’re done. Click the blue sheet of paper icon at the top-left corner of the page to return to the document list. This will bring you back to all of your Google Docs, so you can open an existing one or create a new one. 11. Edit the document in the future. When you want to work on the document, just return to https://docs.google.com , then click the document's name in the file list.",

Here's how you can do it:\n\n**Step 1: Go to Google Docs**\n\nOpen your web browser and navigate to the Google Docs homepage. You can do this by typing `docs.google.com` into your address bar or by searching for \"Google Docs\" in your preferred search engine and clicking on the official link.\n\n**Step 2: Sign in to your Google Account**\n\nIf you're not already signed in, you'll be prompted to enter your Google account credentials (email or phone and password). If you don't have a Google account, you'll need to create one to use Google Docs.\n\n**Step 3: Start a new blank document**\n\nOnce you're on the Google Docs homepage, you'll see an option to \"Start a new document.\" Click on the large, colorful \"Blank\" template, which usually has a plus sign icon. This will open a new, empty document for you to start working on.\n\n**Step 4: Name your document**\n\nBefore you start typing, it's a good idea to name your document. Click on \"Untitled document\" at the top left of the page, delete the placeholder text, and type in a descriptive name for your document. Google Docs automatically saves your work, so you don't have to worry about manually saving it.\n\n",

If you don't see it, click the three-line menu at the top-left corner to expand the sidebar. Make sure you are signed in to your YouTube account if you are not already. You can edit a video's subtitles from a computer or via the YouTube Studio app. 2. Press Manage videos . It is atop your channel's page, just beneath your profile picture. You can also access the Video Manager by clicking your account icon in the top right and navigating to YouTube Studio > Content . 3. Select a video. Choose the video to which you want to add subtitles. If you are uploading a video for the first time, you will already be in position to edit and manage that video. 4. Click Subtitles . The page will display your video's current subtitle tracks , if any. 5. Select a language. Use the drop-down menu to select the language you want for your subtitles. You can add additional subtitle tracks in other languages later. If you want to standardize your subtitles across all videos on your channel, check the box next to \"Make this the default for my channel\". Non-native speakers (and others, like those who are hard of hearing or those with audio processing disorders) may find English language subtitles on English-language videos helpful, so don't be discouraged from subtitling in the video's original language! If you already have a subtitle track, click ADD LANGUAGE before inserting another subtitle track. 6. Click the pencil icon on the subtitle track you want to edit. Hover your mouse over the desired track in the column beneath the Subtitles header. A pencil icon will appear. Click on it to continue. 7. Add your subtitles. There are multiple ways to add subtitles to your YouTube video: Upload file - Add a preexisting subtitle file (SCC, VTT, SRT, SBV) to the video. This wikiHow guide can help you create a subtitle file for your video. Auto-sync - Select this option to type or paste a transcript into the YouTube video editor. YouTube will then attempt to synchronize the text with the audio automatically. Click EDIT TIMINGS to adjust the synchronization. Type manually - Play the video and pause when you want to enter a subtitle. Then, manually enter the text as you listen. Subtitles will be placed in the timeline where you paused the video. Click and drag the bar on either side of the subtitle to change the starting/stopping points. Auto-translate - If you already have a subtitle track in the video's original language, you can then ask YouTube to automatically translate it to another language. 8. Publish the video. When you have completed your subtitling, select PUBLISH and your subtitles will be uploaded to the video.",

If you aren't logged into your Google Account, click the blue Go to Google Drive button in the middle of the page, then enter your Google Account's email address and password. 2. Click NEW . This blue button is in the upper-left corner of the page. A drop-down menu will appear. 3. Select an upload option. Click one of the following options depending on what you want to upload: File upload - Allows you to select a specific file or group of files to upload. Folder upload - Allows you to select an entire folder to upload. 4. Select your file(s) or folder. In the File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) window that opens, go to the files' or folder's location and click the item that you want to upload. You can select multiple files by holding down Ctrl (Windows) or ⌘ Command (Mac) while clicking each file you want to select. Keep in mind that you can't upload more than 15 gigabytes of files without paying for additional storage. 5. Click Open . It's at the bottom of the window. Doing so will confirm your selection and begin uploading the file(s) or folder to Google Drive. If you're uploading a folder, you'll click OK instead. 6. Wait for the file(s) or folder to upload. The amount of time this takes will vary depending on the size of the upload and your Internet connection. Do not close the Google Drive webpage during this time. Once the files finish uploading, you'll be able to access them from Google Drive on any Internet-connected computer or smartphone. 7. Organize your files. Once your files have been uploaded to Google Drive, you can click and drag them to move them into folders if needed. You can also remove unnecessary files by right-clicking them and then clicking Remove . To create a new folder in Google Drive, click NEW , click Folder in the drop-down menu, type in a name, and press ↵ Enter .",

The way you access the Recent Apps menu varies depending on your phone model and which version of Android you are running. Use one of the following steps to access the Recent Apps menu. Gestures: If you are using Android 10 gestures, simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Pill Button: If your phone has an on-screen button that looks like a pill at the bottom-center, swipe up from the pill button. Three-Button Panel: If your phone has three buttons at the bottom of the screen, tap the button that resembles a square, or three vertical lines. 2. Swipe left and right to switch between apps. This navigates between all the apps you have open. Each app is displayed in a small screen in the center. 3. Tap and hold the app you want to open in a split-screen. This displays a pop-up menu. On some Android phone models, you can tap and hold the app screen display in the center of the screen, on other Android models (Samsung Galaxy phones in particular), you'll need to tap and hold the app icon at the top of the app screen display. 4. Tap Spit-screen or Open in split-screen view . This opens the app in split-screen mode. 5. Open a second app. You can either tap a second app on the Recent Apps menu or you can open an app from your home screen or apps menu. This displays both with the screen split down the center. You can adjust the size of the screens by tapping and dragging the blue line that splits the screen in the middle. To exit split-screen mode, tap and drag the blue line that splits the screens completely off-screen.",

While disabling the automatic update service will temporarily halt any Windows 10 & 11 cumulative updates, the service may re-enable itself in the future after a certain amount of time. 2. Type services , and click Services in the search results. Doing so will open the Services window. You can also press the Windows key + R to open the Run window . Type services.msc and press Enter . 3. Scroll down and double-click Windows Update . Doing so opens the Windows Update Properties window. 4. Click the \"Startup type\" menu and select Disabled . It's in the middle of the window. Selecting Disabled will prevent the Windows Update service from automatically starting for the time being. If you don't see this option, first make sure that you're on the right tab by clicking General at the top of the Properties window. 5. Click the Stop button. You'll find this option near the bottom of the window. Clicking it prompts the Windows Update service to stop running. 6. Click Apply , then click OK . Both options are at the bottom of the window. Doing so will apply your settings and close the Properties window. The Windows Update service should now be disabled. 7. Check the update service periodically. Any time you restart your computer or go more than two days without shutting down, open Services and check the \"Windows Update\" status to ensure that it's still disabled. While the Windows Update service shouldn't turn itself back on often, it may occasionally do so. If you see \"Disabled\" to the right of the \"Windows Update\" heading, Windows Update is still disabled. If you see anything other than \"Disabled\" to the right of the \"Windows Update\" heading, disable the Windows Update again.",

This takes you to a page that displays how much storage space you are using as well as a breakdown of how your storage is being used. 3. Review your used and available storage. According to IT expert Gonzalo Martinez, you'll be able to see a nice breakdown of how much storage space you are using as well as where all your data is. You'll also be able to delete apps unused apps to free up space. The bar graph shows how much storage space you have used and how much storage space you have total Subtract the storage space you have used from the total storage space to find out how much storage space you have free. The color coding displays what type of data is taking up storage space on your hard drive. You can see how much data is being used by apps, photos, documents, trash, iOS data, etc. You can scroll down to see exactly how much storage space each app is currently using. You can free up storage space by transferring documents to your iCloud storage or uninstalling or offloading unused apps. Offloading an app will uninstall the app but keep the app data on your device in case you want to use it again. To offload an app, scroll down and tap an app you aren't currently using. Tap Delete to uninstall it or tap Offload app to offload it.",

Use the \"First name,\" \"Last name,\" and \"Company\" fields to name the contact in a meaningful way that you will be able to call up at a later time. 4. Tap add phone . It's below the \"Company\" field. Doing so brings up a text field labeled \"Phone\". 5. Type in the contact's phone number. At a minimum, you'll usually type 10 digits here. The exception to this rule is when you add a number that belongs to a service like Facebook or Venmo, where the phone number is only five digits long. If the number is from a different country, add the corresponding country code (e.g., \"+1\" for the U.S. or \"+44\" for the U.K.) in front of the phone number. You can also change the type of phone associated with the number by tapping home to the left of the Phone field and then tapping an option (e.g., Mobile ). 6. Add additional contact information. Use the labeled fields to add other contact information such as email address, birthday, mailing address, and social media accounts. 7. Tap Done . It's in the top-right corner of the screen.

A large box will pop up after your click your picture, and will have four tabs: \"Upload photos\", \"Your photos\", \"Photos of you\", and \"Web camera\". There are three methods to selecting a picture. Uploading a photo from your computer. For this option, stay on the \"Upload photos\" tab and click the button \"Select a photo from your computer\", or you can just drag the photo onto the box as it directs you to. Choosing photos from Google Plus. For this, click on either \"Your photos\" or \"Photos of you\". These tabs will give you photos you have shared on Google Plus or saved to Google, OR photos you have been tagged in. Take a picture. For this, click on the tab \"Web camera\". This will only work if you have a web camera, so make sure you have one before clicking on this tab. This tab allows you to take a picture using your web camera right there on the spot. 5.

Then scroll down until you find the app. Click on it to open your device's settings. You may also type Settings directly in the Search bar to search for the app. On some launchers, there's a button that leads to Settings on the top-right corner of the swipe-down menu. 2. Go to the \"About phone\" setting. This option is usually used to know all the information about your phone, such as Android version, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), etc. If you are running an emulated instance, look for an option called \"About emulated device\". 3. Find your build number. Depending on your device, it may be hidden behind an extra menu called \"Version\", or under a subheading called \"Device identifiers\" or similar. 4. Click on the build number 7 times. As you approach 7 clicks, you will start seeing a message telling you about the progress (usually \"You are now X step(s) away from being a developer.\"). If developer options are already enabled on your device, you will see a message called \"No need, you are already a developer.\". 5. Enter your device's password to confirm. Since developer options include a very sensitive set of settings, extra confirmation is required to enable these settings. If your device does not have a password, you shall not be shown this interface and will not have to perform this extra step. 6. Look for confirmation. A message saying \"You are now a developer!\" will show on your device. This means that developer mode has been enabled on your device and you may now access developer options. Click on the back button on the top-left corner to return to the main Settings page.",

It's usually the second item in the menu if you have the necessary permissions (if you don't own the folder, you'll need to have Editor-level permissions to change the sharing settings). 4. Tap the users that you want to hide the folder from. If your folder is shared with multiple people, you'll have to repeat this process with everyone. 5. Tap Remove .

You can access them anytime by opening the \"Archive\" folder.\n\n**Method 2: Changing Folder Color (Visual Hiding)**\n\nThis method doesn't technically \"hide\" the folder, but it makes it blend in more or stand out less, especially if you have a lot of folders.\n\n1.  **Right-click on the Folder:** Select the folder you want to make less prominent.\n    2.  **Select \"Change color\":** From the context menu, choose \"Change color\" and pick a color that you associate with \"hidden\" or a color that blends with your background (e.g., a darker shade if your Drive is in dark mode).\n    ",

    "text_ref": "1. Open the Calendar app on your iPhone. You can set up notifications for the events or appointments you add to your Calendar. You'll find the Calendar app on your home screen or in your App Library. The notification alerts you add to your calendar on your iPhone or iPad will also work across all of your Apple devices, including your Mac. 2. Tap the calendar event for which you want to set a reminder. This opens a brief summary of the event. If a reminder is already set, you'll see it (e.g., \"15 minutes before\") next to \"Alert\" on this screen. If no reminder is set, you'll see \"None.\" If you want to create a new calendar event and set a reminder, tap + at the top-right to create an event instead. 3. Tap Edit . This opens the event for editing. If you're creating a new event, just enter the info for your event, including the name, date, location, and other pertinent information. 4. Tap Alert . It's toward the bottom of the event details. You'll see this option whether you're editing an existing reminder or creating a new one. You'll be able to create two reminders for a single event. This is helpful if you want to be reminded before the event and at the time the event begins. 5. Choose when you want to see a reminder. You can have the Calendar app remind you of an event before it begins or right at its start time. Select an option, such as 2 days before or 30 minutes before . Once selected, a reminder will be set. 6. Tap Second alert to add another reminder (optional). If you want to set a second reminder, you can select another time here. For example, you can choose At the time of event if you want this reminder to appear on the screen right when the event or appointment begins. 7. Tap Done to save your event. Now that you've set a reminder, you'll be notified of the event at the time you chose. If you added an address to your event, your iPhone will also give you an automatic reminder when it's time to leave. 8. Change the default reminder time for new events (optional). You can make a quick change in your Calendar settings that makes all new events have reminders set by default. You'll still be able to change the reminder time for each event. Here's how to change your default reminder time: Open your iPhone's Settings . Scroll down and tap Calendar . Tap Default Alert Times . Tap Events . Select a default reminder time.",

You'll usually find it on your home screen or in your app drawer.\n\n\n**Step 2: Go to Recents or Call History**\nOnce in the Phone app, navigate to the **\"Recents\"** or **\"Call History\"** tab. This tab typically displays a list of your incoming, outgoing, and missed calls.\n\n\n**Step 3: Select the Number to Block**\nFind the number you wish to block in your call history. Tap on the number, and then look for an **\"i\" icon** (information) or a **right arrow** next to it. Tapping this will open more details about the call.\n\n\n**Step 4: Block the Number**\nOn the call details screen, you should see an option to **\"Block\"** the number. Tap on it.

Compose your email . Enter your recipient's email address in the \"To\" field, add a subject in the \"Subject\" field (optional), and type in your email's body text in the \"Compose email\" field. 4. Tap the paperclip icon. It's in the upper-right corner of the screen. If this is the first time sending an attachment, you may need to allow access to your device's photo gallery. On Android, tap Attach file or Insert from Drive . 5. Select a photo to upload. You can browse through your most recent photos underneath the Photos header, or tap All to view all your photos. Tap a photo to add it to the body of your email. The photo will be placed in the email in full. If you want to add another photo, tap the paperclip icon again and tap another photo.

Here are the most common ways:\n\n**Method 1: Using Apple Books (for DRM-free ePubs and PDFs)**\n\nThis is the most common method for books you've purchased outside of Apple Books or have downloaded as DRM-free ePubs or PDFs.\n\n**Step 1: Get the eBook onto your computer.**\nFirst, ensure your eBook file (usually an .epub or .pdf) is saved on your computer. If you downloaded it from a website, it's likely in your Downloads folder.\n\n\n**Step 2: Add the eBook to Apple Books on your computer.**\nOpen the \"Books\" app on your Mac. You can drag and drop your eBook file(s) directly into the Books window. Alternatively, go to \"File\" > \"Add to Library...\" and navigate to your eBook file.\n\n\n**Step 3: Sync your iPad with Apple Books.**\nMake sure you are signed into the same Apple ID on both your computer's Books app and your iPad's Books app. If \"iCloud Drive\" and \"Books\" are enabled in your iCloud settings on both devices, your books should automatically sync to your iPad over Wi-Fi. You can check this in \"Settings\" > [Your Name] > \"iCloud\" on your iPad, and in \"System Settings\" (or \"System Preferences\") > \"Apple ID\" > \"iCloud Drive\" > \"Options\" on your Mac.\n\n\n**Method 2: Using AirDrop (for single files)**\n\nAirDrop is great for quickly sending one or two eBook files from your Mac to your iPad.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the eBook file on your Mac.**\nFind the .epub or .pdf file you want to send on your Mac.\n\n\n**Step 2: Share via AirDrop.**\nRight-click (or Control-click) on the eBook file. Select \"Share\" > \"AirDrop.\"\n*Step 3: Select your iPad and accept the file.**\nYour iPad should appear in the AirDrop window. Click on your iPad's icon. On your iPad, you will receive a prompt asking if you want to accept the file. Tap \"Accept.\" It will typically offer to open the file directly in the Books app.\n",

Here's a step-by-step guide with visual aids to help you through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Ensure Your eBook is in the Correct Format\n- **Check the eBook Format**: Make sure your eBook is in a format that is compatible with the iPad. Common formats include EPUB, PDF, and MOBI. If it's not in one of these formats, you might need to convert it using a tool like Calibre or Adobe Digital Editions.\n\n### Step 2: Download and Install the eBook\n- **Download the eBook**: If you haven't already, download the eBook from the source it was purchased from (e.g., Apple Books, Google Play Books, or a website).\n- **Install the eBook**: Open the eBook file on your computer. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or by opening it with a program that supports the file format (like Adobe Acrobat Reader for PDFs).\n\n### Step 3: Transfer the eBook to Your iPad\n- **Use iTunes**: Connect your iPad to your computer using a USB cable. Open iTunes on your computer. In the iTunes window, click on your iPad in the top left corner. Then, click on the \"Books\" tab. Check the box next to \"Sync Books\" and select the eBook you want to transfer. Click \"Apply\" to start the transfer process.\n- **Use iCloud**: If you have iCloud enabled on your iPad, you can also transfer the eBook wirelessly. Make sure the eBook is in your iCloud Books library. Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Books. Ensure the eBook is checked. Then, open the eBook on your iPad and it should be available.\n\n### Step 4: Open and Read the eBook\n- **Open the eBook**: On your iPad, open the Books app. If the eBook is in your library, it should be listed. If not, you can search for it by title or author.\n- **Read the eBook**: Tap on the eBook to open it. You can use the built-in reader or download a third-party eBook reader app from the App Store if you prefer.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Update Your Books App**: Make sure your Books app is up to date. This can help ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes.\n- **Syncing Settings**: If you have multiple iPads, you can set up iCloud Books to sync across all your devices, so you can access the eBook on any iPad with an internet connection.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully put an eBook on your iPad and start reading it.",

Windows will typically display a \"The user name or password is incorrect\" message. After a few attempts, you might see a \"Reset password\" link or similar. If not, just ensure you've tried logging in incorrectly at least once.\n\n**Step 2: Insert Your Password Reset Disk**\nInsert the USB drive that you previously designated as your password reset disk into your computer.\n\n**Step 3: Click \"Reset password\" and Follow the Wizard**\nClick on the \"Reset password\" link. This will launch the Password Reset Wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions, selecting your reset disk when prompted.\n\n**Step 4: Create a New Password**\nEnter a new password and a password hint, then click \"Next\" and \"Finish.\" You can now log in with your new password.\n\n",

Here are the steps to reset a forgotten password on Windows:\n\n1. **Restart Your Computer in Safe Mode:**\n   - Restart your computer.\n   - As the computer is booting up, press the F8 key repeatedly until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears.\n   - Use the arrow keys to select \"Safe Mode\" and press Enter.\n\n2. **Access the Command Prompt:**\n   - In Safe Mode, you can access the Command Prompt. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.\n   - Type \"cmd\" and press Enter.\n\n3. **Change the Password:**\n   - In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter: `net user <username> <new_password>`.\n   - Replace `<username>` with your actual username and `<new_password>` with the new password you want to set.\n\n4. **Restart Your Computer:**\n   - After changing the password, restart your computer. You can do this by pressing the Windows key + X and selecting \"Restart\" from the menu.\n\n5. **Log In with the New Password:**\n   - When your computer boots up again, log in with the new password you set.\n\nIf you don't have access to the computer or the Command Prompt, you can use a bootable USB drive or a CD/DVD with a password reset utility. However, this method requires that you have a working computer to create the bootable media.\n\nRemember, if you're using a Windows 10 or later version, you can also use the \"Forgot Password\" feature in the Settings app to reset your password. This method is more convenient and doesn't require you to restart your computer in Safe Mode.",

    "text_ref": "1. Go to the screen you want to capture. It can be anything on your screen you want to take a picture of. It can be an image, a message, a social media post, an app, a website, etc. 2. Press and hold the Power + Volume Down buttons. The screen will either flash or make a brief animation to indicate a screenshot has been taken. If you have the volume up, you will also hear a camera shutter sound. You will then see the screenshot notification at the bottom or top of your phone, depending on your phone model. On older Android models that have a physical \"Home\" button below the screen, you will need to press and hold the Power button and the Home button below the screen instead. On certain LG, Motorola and HTC phones, you will need to press and hold the Power button and Volume Up button, instead of the Volume Down button. Alternatively, you can use gestures to take a screenshot. The gesture to take a screenshot is to place the edge of your hand vertically on the right side of the screen and swipe from right to left across the screen. You can also use Google Assistant to take a screenshot, simply say \"Hey Google, take a screenshot.\" Some phones have a shortcut that allows you to take a screenshot. To view your shortcuts, swipe down from the top of the screen to view the shortcuts. Tap the screenshot icon. 3. Open the screenshot. To open the screenshot, tap the screenshot thumbnail in the notification that appears after you take a screenshot. If it asks you to select an app to open the screenshot with, tap Gallery and tap Always or Just Once . 4. Tap to share the screenshot. It's the icon with three dots connected by lines in the screenshot notification that appears after you take a screenshot. This displays apps you can share the screenshot over (i.e. social media, email, photo editing app). Tap an app to automatically attach the screenshot to a social media post, direct message, email, or open it in a photo editing app. To send the app over social media or an email, select a recipient, compose a message, and tap the Post/Send icon. 5. Mark up a screenshot. This is useful to highlight sections of a screenshot, or blackout parts of a screenshot you don't want other people to see (i.e. someone's username on social media.) Use the following steps to markup a screenshot: Tap the icon that resembles a pencil or marker tip in the screenshot notification. Tap the icon that resembles a marker, pen, or pencil. Tap a marker or pencil type. Tap the \"X\" icon to go to the previous menu. Tap the colored circle. Tap a color to select a color. Use your finger or a stylus to draw on the screenshot image. Tap Save . 6. Crop a screenshot. Cropping allows you to remove parts of an image you don't need and only capture the parts you do need. Use the following steps to crop a screenshot: Tap the icon that resembles two right angles forming a square in the screenshot notification. On some devices, the markup, and crop icon may be the same icon. Drag the edges of the screen inward so that the area you want to keep is highlighted. Tap Save . 7. Access your screenshots in the Gallery. Use the following steps to access all the screenshots you have taken in the Gallery: Tap icon that resembles a photograph to open the Gallery. Tap the Screenshots folder or album. Tap the screenshot you want to open.",

Here are the most common ways:\n\n**Method 1: Power Button + Volume Down Button**\n\nThis is the most universal method and works on almost all Android devices.\n\n1.  **Navigate to the desired screen:** Go to the app or screen you want to capture.\n2.  **Press and hold:** Simultaneously press and hold the **Power button** and the **Volume Down button** for about one to two seconds.\n        You'll see a quick animation, a flash, or hear a camera shutter sound, indicating the screenshot has been taken. A small preview of the screenshot often appears at the bottom of the screen.\n\n**Method 2: Using the Notification Panel / Quick Settings**\n\nSome Android devices, particularly those with a more customized user interface, offer a screenshot option in the notification panel or quick settings.\n\n1.  **Navigate to the desired screen:** Go to the app or screen you want to capture.\n2.  **Swipe down from the top:** Pull down the notification shade from the top of your screen to reveal your quick settings.\n    3.  **Find the \"Screenshot\" or \"Screen capture\" tile:** Look for an icon that says \"Screenshot,\" \"Screen capture,\" or similar. You might need to swipe left or right on the quick settings panel to find it, or tap an \"Edit\" button to add it if it's not visible.\n    **Method 3: Recent Apps Menu (for Android 9 and newer)**\n\nOn many modern Android phones, you can take a screenshot directly from the recent apps overview.\n\n1.  **Navigate to the desired screen:** Go to the app or screen you want to capture.\n2.  **Open the recent apps menu:** Swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hold, or tap the recent apps button (usually a square icon) if your device uses navigation buttons.\n        You'll see cards of your recently opened applications.\n3.  **Tap \"Screenshot\":** On some devices (like Google Pixel phones), you'll see a \"Screenshot\" button at the bottom of the screen. Tap it to capture the currently displayed app.\n\n**Where to find your screenshots:**\n\nOnce taken, screenshots are usually saved to your device's \"Screenshots\" folder, which you can access through:\n\n*   Your **Gallery** app\n*   Your **Photos** app (Google Photos)\n*   A **File Manager** app (typically in `Internal Storage > DCIM > Screenshots` or `Pictures > Screenshots`)",

Capture the Entire Screen**\n\nTo take a screenshot of your entire screen, simply press **Shift + Command + 3** simultaneously. The screenshot will be saved as a file on your desktop.\n\n**2. Capture a Selected Portion of Your Screen**\n\nIf you only want to capture a specific part of your screen, follow these steps:\n\n*   Press **Shift + Command + 4**. Your cursor will change into a crosshair.\n*   Click and drag the crosshair to select the area you want to capture.\n*   Release your mouse or trackpad button to take the screenshot. This screenshot will also be saved to your desktop.\n\n**3. Capture a Specific Window or Menu**\n\nTo take a screenshot of a particular window or menu:\n\n*   Press **Shift + Command + 4**, then hit the **Spacebar**. Your cursor will change into a camera icon.\n*   Move the camera icon over the window or menu you wish to capture. The window or menu will highlight.\n*   Click your mouse or trackpad button. The screenshot of the selected window or menu will be saved to your desktop.\n\n**4. Capture a Screenshot to the Clipboard (instead of saving to desktop)**\n\nIf you want to paste a screenshot directly into another application without saving it as a file:\n\n*   **Entire Screen to Clipboard:** Press **Shift + Command + Control + 3**.\n*   **Selected Portion to Clipboard:** Press **Shift + Command + Control + 4**, then select your desired area.\n*   **Window/Menu to Clipboard:** Press **Shift + Command + Control + 4**, then the **Spacebar**, and click on the window/menu.\n\nAfter using any of these \"Control\" key combinations, the screenshot will be copied to your clipboard, and you can paste it (Command + V) into any document or application.\n\nHere's an illustration of the different cursor types you might see:\n\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Save a custom sound to your Android. There's a variety of ways to find and save custom sounds. You can download them from a website like notificationsounds.com or you can use an app like Zedge: You can download Zedge for free from the Google Play Store. Although Zedge lets you assign sounds from right in the app, you'll want to download the audio file instead so you can keep using the tones regardless of whether you have Zedge installed. When you find a notification sound you like, tap the download icon and Save to Media Folder. . If you have an audio file (MP3, M4A, WAV, or OGG format) on your computer, transfer it to your Android. One of the easiest ways to do this is to attach the file to an email to yourself and download the attachment on your Android. You can also use a USB cable to transfer the file to your Android device. Some Android phone models only allow you to use WAV or OGG files for notifications and ringtones. 2. Open your file manager app. It usually has an icon that resembles a folder. If you're using a Samsung, it's called My Files . On a Pixel (and many other models), it's called Files . Alternatively, you can download a third-party file manager, such as Cx File Explorer from the Google Play Store. 3. Create a Notifications folder if you don't already have one. Use the file manager to navigate to your Internal Storage and scroll through its contents. Do you see a folder called \"Notifications?\" If not, tap the menu icon ( ⋮ ) and tap Create folder . Rename the new folder \"Notifications.\" Skip this step if you already have a \"Notifications\" folder. 4. Navigate to your downloaded audio files. If you downloaded the file, it's likely in your Download folder, but you may have saved it elsewhere. If the file was already on your Android, it may be in the Music folder. Notification sounds that you downloaded from Zedge will automatically save into your \"Notifications\" folder. However, it's a good idea to look in the folder to make sure the sound you want is there. You're done with this section if you're using Zedge! 5. Copy or move the audio files to your Notifications folder. Your file manager app will let you move or copy this sound file to any directory you want. To do this on a Samsung, tap and hold the audio file, select Move , navigate back to the Notifications folder, and tap Paste . Most other apps work similarly, though you may need to tap a menu after long-tapping the file. 6. Use your new audio file as a notification. Now that you've added your audio file to the correct location, you can use it as your default notification sound , for a specific app , or as a custom text alert .",

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Set Custom Notification Sounds on an Android Phone\n\n#### Step 1: Accessing the Sound Settings\n1. **Open the Settings App**: Tap on the Settings app icon on your home screen or in the app drawer. The icon is typically a gear or a wrench.\n\n#### Step 2: Navigating to Sound Settings\n2. **Scroll Down and Tap on Sound**: In the Settings menu, scroll down and find the \"Sound\" or \"Notifications\" option. Tap on it to proceed.\n\n#### Step 3: Choosing a Custom Sound\n3. **Select Custom Sound**: In the Sound settings, look for the option to choose a custom sound. This might be labeled as \"Custom Sound,\" \"Notification Sound,\" or \"Sound.\" Tap on it.\n\n#### Step 4: Selecting a Sound File\n4. **Choose a Sound File**: You will be presented with a list of available sound files. You can either:\n   - **Select from the List**: Choose from the pre-installed sound files.\n   - **Add a New Sound**: If you have a specific sound file you want to use, you can add it by tapping on \"Add Sound\" or a similar option. This will allow you to select a sound from your device's storage or from a music app.\n\n#### Step 5: Setting the Sound for Notifications\n5. **Set the Custom Sound for Notifications**: Once you have selected your custom sound, you can set it as the notification sound. Look for the option to set the custom sound for notifications and toggle it on.\n\n#### Step 6: Confirming the Change\n6. **Confirm the Change**: A confirmation prompt will appear to ensure you want to set the custom sound. Tap \"OK\" or \"Set\" to confirm.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Use a Short Sound**: For better notification recognition, it's recommended to use a short sound clip.\n- **Test the Sound**: After setting the custom sound, test it by sending a notification to ensure it works as expected.\n- **Accessibility**: If you have accessibility needs, you can set custom sounds for accessibility features as well.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily set custom notification sounds on your Android phone, enhancing your device's personalization and notification experience.",

    "text_ref": "1. Download the Google Voice app. Although it's not possible to hide your real phone number in WhatsApp, you can keep it private by replacing it with one nobody knows. Google Voice lets you create a brand new number for free. To download the app: Open the Play Store or App Store . Tap the search bar or magnifying glass. Type google voice and tap ↵ Enter or Search . Tap Google Voice . Tap INSTALL or GET . Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the app. Note that Google Voice is not available in the UK, Canada, or Europe unless you use a VPN that assigns you a US-based IP address . 2. Sign into your Google account. Open the app and follow the on-screen instructions to enter your login information. Your Google Voice phone number will be connected to the account you use to sign in. But don't worry if you're trying to protect your identity--nobody (other than law enforcement and people at Google) can trace your new phone number back to your Google account. 3. Read the terms and tap CONTINUE . 4. Tap SEARCH . 5. Select a location for your new phone number. You can choose a number by city or area code. If you aren't finding any numbers in your area, try a nearby city or area code. 6. Tap Select next to the phone number you want. Additional instructions for setting up your new phone number will appear. 7. Follow the on-screen instructions to verify your new number. Now that you've set up a Google Voice phone number, see Changing Your WhatsApp Number on Android or Changing Your WhatsApp Number on iPhone or iPad . You'll be given the option to forward your Google Voice phone number to your regular number. If you don't want people on WhatsApp to ring your phone, don't choose this option.",

    "Gemini_text": "Here's a step-by-step guide on how to hide your phone number on WhatsApp:\n\n**Step 1: Open WhatsApp and Go to Settings**\n\nLaunch the WhatsApp application on your smartphone. Once it's open, navigate to the 'Settings' menu. On Android, you usually find this by tapping the three vertical dots in the top right corner. On iPhone, 'Settings' is typically a gear icon at the bottom right.\n\n\n\n**Step 2: Tap on 'Account'**\n\nWithin the 'Settings' menu, you'll see several options. Look for and tap on 'Account'. This is where you manage your privacy, security, and number settings.\n\n\n\n**Step 3: Go to 'Privacy'**\n\nIn the 'Account' section, select 'Privacy'. This is where you can control who sees your personal information, including your 'Last Seen', 'Profile Photo', 'About', and 'Groups'.\n\n\n\n**Step 4: Tap on 'About'**\n\nUnder 'Privacy', find and tap on the 'About' option. Your phone number is linked to your 'About' information, as it's part of your profile details.\n\n\n\n**Step 5: Choose 'Nobody'**\n\nYou'll be presented with options: 'Everyone', 'My contacts', and 'Nobody'. To effectively hide your phone number from others who are not in your contacts or from everyone, select 'Nobody'. This will ensure that only the people you've specifically allowed (or no one at all) can see your information.\n\n",

Doing so opens a list of all apps that currently support notifications. 3. Scroll down and tap Instagram . Apps here are listed alphabetically, so you'll find Instagram in the \"I\" section. If Instagram is not appearing, you may need to wait until you've received a notification from someone. If Instagram is still not appearing in the list, even after receiving a notification in the app, uninstall the Instagram app, restart your phone, and then install it again. When you launch the reinstalled app, select Allow Notifications when prompted, and Instagram should appear in the Notifications section of the Settings app. 4. Tap the white \"Allow Notifications\" switch . It's at the top of the screen. Tapping it will cause it to turn green , signifying that Instagram will send notifications to your iPhone. If you want to disable Instagram notifications completely, tap the green \"Allow Notifications\" switch and then skip the rest of this method. 5. Enable or disable other notifications. Tap the white switch to the right of each of the following options to enable them, or tap the green switch next to each of them to disable them: Sounds - Turn on or off Instagram sounds. Badge App Icon - Turn on or off Instagram badge icons, which are the numbers that display in the corner of the Instagram app when you have pending notifications. Show on Lock Screen - Turn on or off notifications that appear on your iPhone's Lock Screen. Show in History - Turn on or off notifications history for Instagram. Notifications history can be checked by swiping down from the top of the screen. Show as Banners - Turn on or off banner-style notifications, which display at the top of the screen when your iPhone is unlocked. 6. Select an alert style. Below the \"Show as Banners\" switch, tap either Temporary or Persistent . This option won't display if you have \"Show as Banners\" turned off. \"Temporary\" alerts appear briefly at the top of your iPhone's screen before disappearing, while \"Persistent\" alerts don't disappear until you swipe them away. 7. Set a preview option. This will determine whether or not you can see the content of an Instagram notification without opening it. Scroll down and tap Show Previews , then select one of the following options: Always (Default) - You will always see previews for Instagram notifications (e.g., \"Sarah liked your post\"). When Unlocked - You will see previews for Instagram notifications when your iPhone is unlocked. Never - You will never see previews for Instagram notifications. 8. Tap the \"Back\" button twice. It's in the top-left corner of the screen. This will take you back to the Notifications page, saving your changes in the process. Instagram will now send you notifications.",

Here are the illustrated steps to reset your router password:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Your Router's IP Address**\n\n* Check your router's label or documentation to find the IP address. It's usually printed on the bottom or back of the router.\n* Common IP addresses for routers are 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.2.1.\n\n**Step 2: Open a Web Browser**\n\n* Open a web browser on your computer or mobile device.\n* Type the router's IP address in the address bar (e.g., 192.168.0.1) and press Enter.\n\n**Step 3: Log In to Your Router**\n\n* You'll be prompted to enter your router's username and password. The default username and password are usually printed on the router's label or documentation.\n* If you've forgotten your password, you can try resetting it to the default password (usually \"admin\" or \"password\").\n\n**Step 4: Access the Router's Configuration Page**\n\n* Once you're logged in, look for the \"Administration\" or \"Settings\" section.\n* Find the \"Password\" or \"Login\" section and click on it.\n\n**Step 5: Reset the Router Password**\n\n* Look for a \"Reset Password\" or \"Change Password\" option.\n* Click on it and enter a new password.\n* Confirm the new password and click \"Save\" or \"Apply\" to save the changes.\n\n**Step 6: Reboot Your Router**\n\n* After resetting the password, you'll need to reboot your router to apply the changes.\n* Unplug the power cord from your router for 30 seconds, then plug it back in.\n* Wait for the router to restart and reconnect to your network.\n\nThat's it! Your router password has been reset. Remember to write down the new password and keep it safe, as you'll need it to log in to your router in the future.",

    "text_ref": "1. Open the Play Store . You’ll usually find it on your Android's home screen or in the app drawer. If your Android is not set to update apps automatically, WhatsApp won't update until you check for updates manually. You can use this method to update WhatsApp in this situation. 2. Tap the Search tab. On phones, it's the third tab at bottom of screen, and on tablet, it's the third tab at left. 3. Type whatsapp into the search bar. It’s at the top of the screen. 4. Tap WhatsApp Messenger . It has a green chat bubble icon with a phone receiver inside. Alternatively, tap your profile icon > Manage apps and devices > Manage > WhatsApp . 5. Tap Update . It’s the blue button next to Uninstall . The latest version of WhatsApp will now download and install on your Android. If the blue button does not say Update , you are already using the latest version of WhatsApp. If you know you're running an older version of WhatsApp, you can try downloading the APK file to force an update instead. Otherwise, see our troubleshooting method. 6. Enable automatic updates (optional). If you want to make sure you always have the latest version of WhatsApp on your Android, you can enable automatic updates in the Play Store. Here's how: Tap your profile icon at the top-right corner of the Play Store. Tap Settings . Tap Network Preferences . Tap Auto-update apps . Select Update over Wi-Fi only . We recommend this option so you don't have updates installing in the background when you're using mobile data. If you have unlimited mobile data and don't mind using it to update apps, you can select Update with limited amount of mobile data (to still conserve some data) or Update all apps over Wi-Fi or mobile data . 7. Allow unknown apps on Android. In most cases, you should only need to use this method to update WhatsApp if you installed it from an APK file. Before you can download any APK files, you must enable the setting to sideload apps through your web browser. The steps may vary depending on your phone or tablet. Do the following: Open Settings . Tap Apps or Apps & Notifications . Scroll down or tap the three-dots icon. Tap Special access or Special app access . Tap Install unknown apps . Tap your mobile browser. Toggle on Allow from this source . 8. Go to the WhatsApp download page for Android. Use your mobile browser to visit the link. 9. Tap Download WhatsApp directly . This is below the Google Play button. If prompted, tap OK or Download anyway to bypass the warning. 10. Tap the WhatsApp file. You can find this in the Downloads section of your browser or in your file manager. 11. Tap Install . WhatsApp will begin downloading on your device. When the installation is complete, you'll have the most up-to-date version of WhatsApp. Once WhatsApp has been installed, tap it to open it. If it loads properly, be sure to delete the APK file since this can take up extra space. If you're still having trouble, see the troubleshooting section. 12. Make sure you have enough space. If your Android phone or tablet is almost at max capacity, you may not have enough space to update WhatsApp. Check your storage in your settings. If you're almost out of space, try transferring your photos and videos to a cloud service such as Google Photos or Drive . 13. Check if your device is compatible. If you have an older Android device, it may not be compatible with newer WhatsApp updates. WhatsApp will only work on Android devices that have Android 5.0 or newer and can receive SMS messages or calls. You can check your Android version in Settings > About phone/tablet > Android version . 14. Check if WhatsApp is available in your location. If you're getting this error code, you may have your device set to the wrong region. If it's set to the correct region, WhatsApp isn't currently available for you. To check your region, do the following: Open the Google Play Store . Tap your profile icon. Go to Settings > General > Account and device preferences > Country and profiles . Select the country. 15. Try updating WhatsApp using Wi-Fi. If you're trying to update WhatsApp using cellular data, it may not be strong enough to properly download the update. Connect to Wi-Fi and try updating from the Google Play Store again. 16. Delete the app fully and download it again. If you can't update WhatsApp, try completely deleting the app first. Then, download it again from the Google Play Store. 17. Clear the Google Play Store cache. This can help fix issues, including apps that won't update, by clearing any corrupted data. Do the following: Open Settings . Tap Apps & notifications . Tap See all apps . Tap Google Play Store . Tap Storage . Tap Clear Cache . Tap Clear data . Open the Google Play Store and try downloading WhatsApp again.",

Once your site is open, navigate to the specific page where you want to add the image. You can do this using the \"Pages\" tab on the right-hand sidebar.\n**Step 2: Insert Image**\nOn the right-hand sidebar, click on the \"Insert\" tab. Then, choose either \"Images\" to upload a new image from your computer or \"Embed URL\" if your image is hosted online. For this example, we'll choose \"Images.\"\n**Step 3: Upload Image**\nAfter clicking \"Images,\" you'll see options to \"Upload\" or \"Select image.\" If you click \"Upload,\" a file explorer window will open. Navigate to the image you want to add on your computer, select it, and click \"Open.\"\n**Step 4: Image Placed on Site**\nYour image will now appear on your Google Site page. You can click and drag it to reposition it, or use the handles around the image to resize it. You'll also see a toolbar appear above the image with options to crop, uncrop, add a link, or delete the image.\n",

    "prompt": "How to change screen timeout on Android? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Open your Android's Settings . You can get there by tapping the gear-shaped icon in your Apps list. Alternatively, you can also find the Settings menu by swiping down from the top of the screen and tapping the icon that resembles a gear. This method works for all models of Android, including Samsung, LG, and Google Pixel. 2. Tap Display . You should see this option on most Androids, although some models have varying language on their menus. 3. Tap Screen timeout . If you're using a Samsung model, you'll usually find this at the bottom of the menu. If you're using a recent Pixel model or another brand, you may have to tap Advanced and then Screen timeout or Sleep instead. If you are having a hard time finding this option, tap the magnifying glass icon in the upper-right corner of the Settings menu. Then type \"Screen Timeout\" or \"Sleep\" in the search bar. 4. Choose how long your phone screen should stay on when idle. Tap the radio option next to the time you want your phone or tablet to wait before your phone screen times out. The smallest option is 15 seconds , which conserves the least amount of battery power. The largest option, 30 minutes , will consume the most. Once you tap your selection, it will take effect immediately. Some phones have fewer options from which to choose. For example, some Androids won't let you choose a timeout length longer than 5 minutes. Newer Samsung models have a \"keep screen on while viewing\" toggle. Tap that to enable it so your screen doesn't turn off while the front camera detects your face. If you're using an older Samsung phone with Smart Stay enabled, your phone's screen will stay illuminated as long as you are looking at the screen regardless of what you select here. Continue reading to customize your Smart Stay settings on some Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets. 5. Open up your Samsung Galaxy's Settings . It's the gear-shaped icon in your apps list. Some older Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets, like the Galaxy Note 2, have the option of enabling Smart Stay, which is a feature that keeps your phone's screen on as long as you are looking at it. Smart Stay uses your phone's front camera to do this. This setting will override your the screen timeout settings. Alternatively, you can swipe down from the top of the screen and tap the icon that resembles a gear to open the Settings menu. 6. Scroll down and tap Advanced features . It's fairly close to the bottom of the menu. It's next to a yellow icon that resembles a gear with a plus (+) sign in the middle. You may have to select Controls on some models. If you are unable to locate the Smart Stay option in your Settings menu, tap the magnifying glass icon in the upper-right corner of the menu and type \"Smart Stay\" in the search bar. This feature may not be available on all Samsung Galaxy devices. 7. Tap Motions and gestures . It's near the bottom of the Advanced Features menu. 8. Tap Smart Stay . Now you'll see the Smart Stay switch. If Smart Stay is disabled, the switch will be gray or white. If it's another color, Smart Stay is already turned on. You can tap the colored switch to disable Smart Stay if you don't want to use your phone's camera to sense whether you are looking at the screen. 9. Slide the switch to the On position . Once Smart Stay is enabled, your Android's screen will stay illuminated as long as the camera can sense your face. Smart Stay may not work properly in a dark room due to its dependence on the camera.",

Tap What's on your mind? or Write something here . One of these options will appear at the top of the screen below the story icons. 3. Tap Photo/Video . It's the green photo icon below the typing area. This opens your phone or tablet's camera roll. If you haven't yet given Facebook permission to access your photos, follow the on-screen instructions to do so when prompted. 4. Select photos to include in the album. The photos you select will appear in the album in the order they're selected. 5. Tap Done when you're finished. It's at the top-right corner. 6. Tap the + Album button. It's near the top of the screen just below your name. 7. Tap + Create Album . It's the first option at the top of the menu. 8. Enter an album title and description. The album's title is mandatory, but the description is optional. Tap the Album name field to enter a descriptive name for your album, and the Add a description field (optional) to type anything else you'd like to include about the photos. 9. Select an audience. The privacy menu is just below the \"Description\" field. It'll be set to your default post privacy setting by default. If you want to change who can see your album, tap the menu and select one of these options: Public (anyone on Facebook) Friends (your Facebook friends) Friends except… (all friends except any you add to a list) Specific friends (only friends you add to a list) Only me (private) 10. Allow friends to add photos (optional). If you'd like certain Facebook friends to be able to contribute their own photos to this album, slide the \"Add Contributors\" switch to the On (blue) position, and then tap Choose Friends to select some friends. If not, leave this switch alone. 11. Tap Save (iPhone/iPad) or CREATE (Android). This prepares the selected photos for your new album. 12. Tap Upload (iPhone/iPad) or Post (Android). This uploads the selected photos and adds them to your new album. You'll find your album in the Photos section of your profile.",

It won't be possible to modify the Chrome shortcut that's in your Start menu or on your taskbar, but you can create a special incognito mode shortcut for your desktop. Here's an easy way to do this: First, if you already have a Google Chrome icon on your desktop, you can skip this step. Otherwise, click the Start menu or press the Windows key on your keyboard to open the menu. Locate the Chrome icon (it's the round red, green, yellow, and blue icon) but don't click it. Drag the Chrome icon to your desktop. This places a new icon called Google Chrome onto your desktop. If you can't see the desktop, press Windows key + D , return to the menu, and then drag the icon. If you already had a Chrome icon on your desktop, this new shortcut will be called Google Chrome (2) . 2. Right-click the Google Chrome icon on your desktop. A menu will expand. 3. Click Properties on the menu. This opens the Google Chrome Properties dialog window. 4. Add -incognito to the end of the \"Target\" field. Look at the address you see next to \"Target\" –this is the full path to Google Chrome. You'll need to add -incognito after that path. Since the last character is a quotation mark (\"), click the mouse after the quotation, press the spacebar, and then type -incognito . For example: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" -incognito You can restore your previous setting by removing -incognito from the Target text box and saving it. 5. Click OK . This saves your changes. 6. Rename the new Google Chrome icon on your desktop (optional). It may be helpful to rename the desktop icon to something like \"Chrome Incognito\" so you know what it does. To do this, right-click the Chrome icon on your desktop, select Rename , type Chrome Incognito , and then press the Enter key. 7. Double-click the Google Chrome icon on your desktop. As long as you open Chrome by double-clicking this icon, it will always open in incognito mode. If you open Chrome from your Windows Start menu or in any way other than double-clicking this new icon on your desktop, Chrome will not open in incognito mode. Remember to always double-click the icon that's on your desktop to open the incognito version of Chrome. You can still switch to incognito mode from a standard Chrome window by pressing Ctrl + Shift + N on the keyboard.",

    "text_ref": "1. Close any open Google Chrome windows. Windows won't uninstall a program if it is currently running; closing Chrome will prevent this problem from occurring. 2. Force-quit Chrome if necessary. To avoid errors saying that Google Chrome is still running even though you've closed all of its windows, check to make sure all Google Chrome processes have stopped and force-quit any Google Chrome processes still running. Use the following steps to force-quit Google Chrome: Press Ctrl + ⇧ Shift + Esc to open the Task Manager. Click the Processes tab. Click Google Chrome in the main window. Click End task in the bottom-right corner of the Task Manager. On Windows 11, you can right-click Google Chrome and choose End task instead. 3. Right-click the Windows icon and click Apps & programs . If you're using Windows 11, you'll instead click Installed apps . 4. Scroll down and click Google Chrome . You'll find Google Chrome in the \"G\" section of the list of currently installed apps. If you don't see Chrome here, make sure you're sorting by name by clicking the \"Sort by\" option and then clicking Name . 5. Click Uninstall twice. You'll click Uninstall once under Google Chrome's name, then you'll click it again when it pops up above Google Chrome's name. 6. Click Yes when prompted. This will allow Google Chrome to run its uninstaller. 7. Click Uninstall when prompted. Doing so will prompt Google Chrome to uninstall. You may also want to have Chrome delete your browsing history by checking the \"Also delete your browsing data?\" box. 8. Delete the Google Chrome installation folder if necessary. If you still see the Google Chrome icon in the taskbar, desktop, or Start menu, or you reinstall Google Chrome and continue to experience issues with it, you may need to delete the Google Chrome installation folders. First, make sure you have hidden files and folders showing in File Explorer. Then use the following steps to delete the Google Chrome installation folders: Press ⊞ Win + E to open File Explorer. Click your Windows Installation (C:) drive. Open the following folders: users > Your Username > AppData > Local > Google . Right-click the Chrome folder and click Delete . Open the following folders: Program Files (x86) > Google . 9. Close Google Chrome. Hold down Ctrl while clicking the Google Chrome app icon in your Mac's Dock, then click Quit in the resulting pop-up window. If Google Chrome is already closed, you won't see Quit in the menu. 10. Force-quit Chrome if necessary. If you're receiving errors that say Chrome is running even though you've closed it, do the following before attempting to uninstall Google Chrome: Press ⌥ Option + ⌘ Command + Esc at the same time. Select Google Chrome in the pop-up window. Click Force Quit in the bottom-right corner of the pop-up window. Click Force Quit when prompted. 11. Open Finder. Click the Finder app icon, which resembles a blue face, in the Dock. 12. Click Go . It's a menu item at the top of your Mac's screen. A drop-down menu will appear. 13. Click Applications . You'll find this option in the drop-down menu. Doing so opens a list of your Mac's installed applications. 14. Locate Google Chrome. Google Chrome is the red, green, yellow, and blue app here, though you may have to scroll down to find it. 15. Place Google Chrome in the Trash. Click and drag the Chrome app icon onto the Trash icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen, then release it there. This will remove Chrome from your Mac. 16. Delete the Chrome installation folder if necessary. If you still see the Google Chrome icon in the Dock or Applications folder, or you try to reinstall Google Chrome and it has the same issues as before, you may need to delete the installation folder. Use the following steps to delete the installation folder: Open Finder . Click Go . Hold \" Option \" and click Library . Open the Application Support folder followed by the Google folder. Drag and drop the Chrome folder into the Trash. 17. Locate the Google Chrome app. It's white with a yellow, green, red, and blue sphere on it. 18. Tap and hold Google Chrome. After a second, a menu will pop up with several options. 19. Tap Remove App . This is the first option on the menu. 20. Select Delete App . This option will completely delete Chrome and associated data from your iPhone. Select Delete App , then tap Delete in the popup window to confirm. This process will also work on an iPad or iPod touch. 21. Open your Android's Settings. Swipe down from the top of your Android's screen, then tap the gear-shaped \"Settings\" icon in the top-right corner of the resulting drop-down menu. On some Androids, you must use two fingers to swipe down. If Google Chrome came pre-installed on your Android phone, you cannot uninstall it. You can only disable it. If you need to clear space on your Android phone, you can delete the cache , cookies, and history . 22. Tap Apps . It's in the Settings menu. Doing so opens a list of your Android's installed apps. 23. Find and select Chrome. Scroll down until you find the red, yellow, green, and blue sphere-shaped Chrome app icon, then tap it. 24. Tap UNINSTALL . This option is below the \"Google Chrome\" heading at the top of the screen. If you instead see DISABLE here, Chrome cannot be uninstalled from your Android. To disable and hide Chrome, tap DISABLE and then tap DISABLE when prompted. 25. Tap UNINSTALL when prompted. Doing so will uninstall Chrome from your Android.",

Click Edit next to \"Input Sources.\" You'll see this on the right side of the window under the \"Text Input\" header with a list of current languages. 4. Click ➕ below the left pane of the dialog box. You'll find the plus sign icon below the left pane where your keyboard's current languages are displayed. Clicking this will allow you to add another language to your keyboard so you can easily switch to it. 5. Click on a language. They're listed alphabetically. Keyboard languages that have already been added are at the top of the list. 6. Click the desired keyboard/input style for the language. They're displayed in the right pane of the dialog box. An example of the keyboard layout will appear below the right pane when you click on an input source. 7. Click on Add . You'll be able to type in that language now, but you still have to switch your keyboard to that language. Follow the next steps to switch. 8. Toggle on Show Input menu in menu bar . Make sure the toggle next to \"Show input menu in menu bar\" is enabled (showing blue) so you can quickly switch your keyboard language. You'll see this option at the top of the Input Sources menu. When you're finished, click Done at the bottom right corner of the window. 9. Click on the flag or language icon on the right side of the menu bar. Look for a symbol in the menu bar at the top of your Mac's screen. It should look like a flag or a rectangle containing a language symbol (such as US for American English). Click it to open a dropdown menu. 10. Click on the language you want to use with your keyboard. Follow the same steps whenever you want to change the language again. Alternatively, press the Globe key to change your input language. If pressing it does nothing or something else, go to System Settings > Keyboard and make sure the Globe key is set to change your input source.",

This will open a window where you can manage your keyboard layouts.\n\n**Step 4: Add a New Language.**\nClick the \"+\" button at the bottom left of the Input Sources window.\n\n**Step 5: Select Your Language.**\nA list of languages will appear. Search for or scroll to the language you want to add and select it. Then, choose the specific input method you prefer for that language (e.g., \"ABC - Extended\" for a phonetic input, or a specific keyboard layout). Click \"Add.\"\n**Step 6: Switch Languages.**\nOnce added, you'll see a flag or a language indicator in the menu bar at the top of your screen. Click on it to switch between your added languages. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Control + Space` (or `Command + Space` if you've customized it) to cycle through input sources.\n**Method 2: Using the Character Viewer (for occasional special characters)**\n\nThis method is useful if you only need to insert a few special characters from another language occasionally, rather than typing extensively in it.\n\n**Step 1: Open the Character Viewer.**\nWhile typing in any application, place your cursor where you want to insert a special character. Go to the \"Edit\" menu in the application's menu bar and select \"Emoji & Symbols\" (or press `Control + Command + Space`).\n\n**Step 2: Browse and Insert Characters.**\nThe Character Viewer will appear. You can browse by category, search for specific characters, or use the language-specific sections. Double-click a character to insert it into your text.\n\n",

Most Facebook profiles limit interaction to people who have requested to connect, rather than allowing the public to comment. Use the search bar at the top of your profile to find friends based on their names. Start using Facebook’s suggestions once you have some friends. Click on the Friends tab under your cover photo. Then, click the “Find Friends” button. Scroll through the section entitled “People You May Know.” Submit a Friend Request to anyone with whom you want to interact. Return to the Friends tab to find friends through your email address. Find the section that says “Find Personal Contacts” on the right side of the page. Enter your Hotmail, Yahoo, AOL, or iCloud email. Click the “Find Friends” button and you will give Facebook permission to import email contacts and invite them to be friends. 3. Search for businesses, organizations and media that you like using the same search bar. Click “Like” to get their Facebook page updates and be able to comment on their pages. 4. Click the Home button on your profile to see the News Feed with your friends’ and pages’ status updates. You should see a fresh stream of updates every few minutes. You can also access your News Feed through third-party Facebook apps. Once you have downloaded the app to your phone, tablet or computer, enter your Facebook account details and click the “Home” or “News Feed” sections. 5. Choose a status update or post on which you would like to comment. Hover over it. Click the “Comments” box to see other comments and enable your own comments. 6. Scroll to the bottom of the existing comments. Type your comment in the box. When you are satisfied, press “Enter” to publish your comment on Facebook. 7. Edit your comment by hovering your cursor over it. Find the pencil that appears to the right of the highlighted column and click it. Click “Edit” and change your text to fix it. Your comment will list the date and time of the last edit you made. Friends can click on the “Edited” link under the comment to see what you changed. 8. Delete your comment entirely by highlighting it and clicking on the pencil icon. Choose “Delete” in the drop down box. Confirm you want to delete the comment. Beware that record of your comment may still exist on Facebook servers.",

Skip this step on Android. 4. Tap Account Settings . This option will take you to your Account Settings page. On Android, you must first scroll down. 5. Tap Blocking . It's in the second group of options on this page, near the bottom of the screen. For some smaller phones, you may first have to scroll down. 6. Tap the name field. It's the text box that says \"Type a name or email\" near the top of the screen. 7. Type in the name of the person you want to block, then tap Block . This will take you to the confirmation page. If you have this person's email address, you can type that in instead. 8. Tap Block next to the profile you want to block. Facebook will bring up several profiles that match the name you entered; tap Block to the right of the one you want to block. 9. Tap Block when prompted. It's the blue button near the bottom of the page. Doing so will block your selected user. 10. Go to Facebook's website. Go to https://www.facebook.com in your preferred browser. This will load your News Feed if you're already logged into Facebook. If you aren't already logged into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) and password before continuing. 11. Click on your profile picture. It is in the upper-right side of the Facebook page. Doing so prompts a drop-down menu. 12. Click \"Settings & privacy .

Facebook will bring up a list of people who match the name you entered; click Block next to the correct profile. 19. Click Confirm when prompted. This is the blue button at the bottom of the pop-up window. You can also select \"Ban [username] and any new profiles that they create\". This will also automatically ban any pages that they make if they ever make any. 20. Click Confirm again. This will block them.",

Click \"Block\" to proceed.\n\n### Step 5: Confirm Blocking\n1. **Review Block**: The person will be blocked from your account. You will not be able to see their posts, and they will not be able to see yours.\n2. **Close Window**: Once you confirm the block, close the pop-up window.\n\n### Step 6: Verify Blocking\n1. **Check Your Feed**: Go back to your feed to ensure that the person's posts are no longer visible.\n2. **Check Their Profile**: Try visiting the person's profile to confirm that you are blocked.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Blocking vs. Hiding**: Blocking is a permanent action, while hiding someone's posts is temporary and can be reversed.\n- **Blocking Multiple People**: You can block multiple people by following the same steps for each one.\n- **Blocking on Mobile**: The process is similar on mobile devices, but you might need to use a different menu layout.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively block someone on Facebook, ensuring a more comfortable and respectful online experience.",

This section is at the top of the page. 5. Tap Music . It's the white app with a multicolored musical note on its front. Since the apps here are organized by the amount of space they take up, your Music app's location will vary. 6. Decide on what you want to delete. You can delete every song on your iPhone from the \"All Songs\" category at the top of this page, or you can delete an artist from the list below \"All Songs\". Additionally, you can be more specific: Tap a specific artist's name to view their \"Albums\" page. Tapping a specific album's name to view its songs. 7. Tap Edit . It will be in the top-right corner of the screen on any of the pages within the \"Music\" section. 8. Tap the red circle to the left of an option. Make sure you're doing this next to the song, album, or artist you wish to remove from your iPhone. 9. Tap Delete . It's on the far-right side of your selected option. Doing so will immediately remove your song, album, or artist both from the Music app and from your iPhone. 10. Tap Done when you're finished. This option is in the top-right corner of the screen. Your selected music items are now gone from your iPhone.",

To quickly search for an app, swipe right on the home screen, type the app's name into the Search bar at the top, and then tap the app in the search results. You can scroll through iPhone home screens by swiping left on the screen. 2. Tap and hold the icon. You don't need to press down particularly hard; simply long-press lightly over the icon for a second or so. You can lift your finger when the pop-up menu appears. If you haven't updated your iPhone to iOS 13.2, you won't see a menu. Instead, all of the icons on the screen will begin to jiggle. If you want to delete multiple apps, click \"Edit home screen.\" 3. Tap Remove App on the menu. A confirmation window will appear. If tapping and holding the icon made the icons on your screen jiggle, tap the minus sign \" - \" at the top of the icon to delete it. Some apps, such as the App Store, cannot be deleted. 4. Tap Delete App to confirm. This deletes the app from your iPhone. If you select Remove from Home Screen instead of Delete App , the app will remain on your iPhone but no longer appear on your home screen--only in your App Library. Deleting an app will not cancel any in-app paid subscriptions. If you are being billed by iTunes for a particular app, see this wikiHow to learn how to cancel your subscription. 5. Swipe left on the home screen to the App Library. Depending on how many home screens you have, you may have to swipe left multiple times. You'll know you're in the right place when you see \"App Library\" at the top of the screen. 6. Tap App Library . It's in the search bar at the top of the screen. A list of all apps installed on your iPhone will appear. 7. Tap and hold the icon for the app you want to delete. Don't tap and hold the app's name—just its icon, which is to the left of its name. You don't need to press down particularly hard; simply long-press lightly over the icon for a second or so. You can lift your finger when the pop-up menu appears 8. Tap Delete app . It's at the bottom of the menu. A confirmation message will appear. 9. Tap Delete to confirm. This removes the app from your iPhone. Deleting an app will not cancel any in-app paid subscriptions.

    "text_ref": "1. Go to the screen you want to capture. It can be anything on your screen you want to take a picture of. It can be an image, a message, a social media post, an app, a website, etc. 2. Press and hold the Power + Volume Down buttons. The screen will either flash or make a brief animation to indicate a screenshot has been taken. If you have the volume up, you will also hear a camera shutter sound. You will then see the screenshot notification at the bottom or top of your phone, depending on your phone model. On older Android models that have a physical \"Home\" button below the screen, you will need to press and hold the Power button and the Home button below the screen instead. On certain LG, Motorola and HTC phones, you will need to press and hold the Power button and Volume Up button, instead of the Volume Down button. Alternatively, you can use gestures to take a screenshot. The gesture to take a screenshot is to place the edge of your hand vertically on the right side of the screen and swipe from right to left across the screen. You can also use Google Assistant to take a screenshot, simply say \"Hey Google, take a screenshot.\" Some phones have a shortcut that allows you to take a screenshot. To view your shortcuts, swipe down from the top of the screen to view the shortcuts. Tap the screenshot icon. 3. Open the screenshot. To open the screenshot, tap the screenshot thumbnail in the notification that appears after you take a screenshot. If it asks you to select an app to open the screenshot with, tap Gallery and tap Always or Just Once . 4. Tap to share the screenshot. It's the icon with three dots connected by lines in the screenshot notification that appears after you take a screenshot. This displays apps you can share the screenshot over (i.e. social media, email, photo editing app). Tap an app to automatically attach the screenshot to a social media post, direct message, email, or open it in a photo editing app. To send the app over social media or an email, select a recipient, compose a message, and tap the Post/Send icon. 5. Mark up a screenshot. This is useful to highlight sections of a screenshot, or blackout parts of a screenshot you don't want other people to see (i.e. someone's username on social media.) Use the following steps to markup a screenshot: Tap the icon that resembles a pencil or marker tip in the screenshot notification. Tap the icon that resembles a marker, pen, or pencil. Tap a marker or pencil type. Tap the \"X\" icon to go to the previous menu. Tap the colored circle. Tap a color to select a color. Use your finger or a stylus to draw on the screenshot image. Tap Save . 6. Crop a screenshot. Cropping allows you to remove parts of an image you don't need and only capture the parts you do need. Use the following steps to crop a screenshot: Tap the icon that resembles two right angles forming a square in the screenshot notification. On some devices, the markup, and crop icon may be the same icon. Drag the edges of the screen inward so that the area you want to keep is highlighted. Tap Save . 7. Access your screenshots in the Gallery. Use the following steps to access all the screenshots you have taken in the Gallery: Tap icon that resembles a photograph to open the Gallery. Tap the Screenshots folder or album. Tap the screenshot you want to open.",

Here's a step-by-step guide with illustrations to help you take a screenshot on your Android device:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Taking a Screenshot on Android\n\n#### Step 1: Prepare Your Screen\n1. **Open the App or Screen You Want to Screenshot**: Make sure you have the app or screen you want to capture open on your Android device.\n\n#### Step 2: Find the Screenshot Button\n2. **Locate the Screenshot Button**: The location of the screenshot button can vary depending on the device and Android version. Commonly, it's found in the following places:\n   - **Physical Buttons**: On some devices, you can use the physical buttons. For example, on a Samsung device, you might use the Power button and Volume down button simultaneously.\n   - **On-Screen Keyboard**: On some devices, you can access the screenshot button through the on-screen keyboard. Look for a button that looks like a camera or a screenshot icon.\n   - **Settings**: Some devices allow you to take a screenshot through the settings menu. Look for the \"Screenshots\" or \"Capture\" option.\n\n#### Step 3: Take the Screenshot\n3. **Press the Screenshot Button**: Once you've located the button, press it. The exact combination of buttons or the action you need to take will depend on your device.\n\n#### Step 4: Confirm the Screenshot\n4. **Check the Screenshot**: After taking the screenshot, you might see a notification or a preview of the screenshot. This is usually a quick way to confirm that the screenshot was taken successfully.\n\n#### Step 5: Save or Share the Screenshot\n5. **Save or Share**: You can save the screenshot to your device's gallery or share it with others through various apps and services.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Use a Screenshot App**: If the built-in screenshot feature doesn't work for you, you can use a third-party screenshot app. These apps often offer more features and customization options.\n- **Accessibility Features**: Some devices have accessibility features that can help you take screenshots more easily, especially if you have difficulty using physical buttons.\n\n### Example of a Screenshot Button on a Samsung Device\n- **Physical Buttons**: Press the Power button and Volume down button simultaneously.\n- **On-Screen Keyboard**: Look for a button that looks like a camera or a screenshot icon on the on-screen keyboard.\n\n### Example of a Screenshot Button on a Google Pixel Device\n- **On-Screen Keyboard**: Look for a button that looks like a camera or a screenshot icon on the on-screen keyboard.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to take a screenshot on your Android device. If you're still having trouble, you can try searching for specific instructions for your device model or checking the device's user manual.",

If you have any open programs, you may be prompted to close them before the computer powers down. 4. Perform a hardware reboot. If the computer is frozen, you’ll need to do a hardware reboot. You should only do this if the previous steps didn’t work. Here’s how: Press and hold the power button on the computer until it turns off. This button is usually located on the side of your laptop, or on the front of the “tower” part of your desktop computer. Press the power button once again to turn it back on. 5. Press Ctrl + Alt + Del on the keyboard. This brings up the lock screen. If the computer is performing slowly, it may be a few moments before it appears. If you’re connected to the computer remotely with Windows Remote Desktop, the keyboard shortcut won’t work. Instead, open a command prompt on the remote computer and run the following command: shutdown –r . 6. Click the arrow next to the power button. It’s the red button at the bottom right corner of the screen. 7. Click Restart . The computer will now reboot. If you have any open programs, you may be asked to close them before the computer restarts. 8. Perform a hardware reboot. If the previous steps didn’t work, you’ll need use the power button on the computer to restart it. You should only do this if the computer will not restart. Press and hold the power button on the computer until it turns off. This button is usually located on the side of your laptop, or on the front of the “tower” part of your desktop computer. Press the power button once again to turn it back on. 9. Press Control + ⌘ Command + ⏏ Eject . This command will close all open programs and restart your Mac. If you have any unsaved work, you’ll be prompted to save it before the computer restarts. If your computer is performing slowly it may take several minutes for the computer to restart. Another way to do this is to open the Apple menu (at the top left corner of the screen) and click Restart . If you’re connected to computer remotely, you can restart it with sudo shutdown -r now . 10. Force a hardware reboot. You should only do this if you were unable to restart the computer. A hardware reboot should be a last resort step as it can cause data loss. Press and hold the power button on the keyboard’s upper right corner (or the back of a desktop computer) until it powers off. Then, press the power button again to turn the computer back on.",

FaceTime is only available on iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch) and macOS devices (MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac Mini). If you're using an Android device, you can use Google Duo or other video calling apps instead.\n\n**Step 2: Open the FaceTime app**\nOn your iOS device, go to the App Store and download the FaceTime app if you haven't already. Once you have the app, open it by tapping on the FaceTime icon on your home screen.\n\n**Step 3: Sign in with your Apple ID**\nIf you're not already signed in, enter your Apple ID and password to sign in to FaceTime. If you're using an iPhone or iPad, you can also use FaceTime with your Apple ID and password.\n\n**Step 4: Choose a contact**\nIn the FaceTime app, you can choose a contact from your contacts list or search for a contact by name. You can also add a new contact by tapping on the \"Add Contact\" button.\n\n**Step 5: Start a video call**\nOnce you've selected a contact, tap on the \"Video\" button to start a video call. If you're using an iPhone or iPad, you can also start a video call by tapping on the \"Video\" button in the FaceTime app.\n\n**Step 6: Adjust your camera and microphone settings**\nBefore you start the call, you can adjust your camera and microphone settings to ensure that you're using the correct camera and microphone. Tap on the \"Settings\" button in the FaceTime app to adjust your settings.\n\n**Step 7: Make the call**\nOnce you've adjusted your settings, tap on the \"Video\" button to start the call. Your contact will receive a notification that you're calling them, and they can answer the call by tapping on the \"Answer\" button.\n\n**Step 8: Enjoy your FaceTime call**\nOnce you've started the call, you can enjoy your FaceTime call with your contact. You can use the controls in the FaceTime app to adjust your camera and microphone settings, and you can also use the \"Share Play\" feature to share your screen with your contact.\n\nThat's it!
